# God Reconciler

Before doing feature work, reconcile against every artifact the work could
touch. Not just roadmap. Not just PRD. All of them.

## Why this exists

A feature addition often impacts multiple artifacts:
- PRD may be missing the requirement
- ARCH may need a delta (new component, new ADR)
- ROADMAP may have it as a planned milestone
- STACK may need a new dependency
- BACKLOG may already capture the intent
- SEEDS may trigger a planted seed
- README, release notes, schemas, workflows, recipes, and installed-project
  feature awareness may need mechanical sync

If we don't check all of these, we get drift. Roadmap says one thing, PRD
says another, code does a third.

## Inputs

- User intent (one paragraph describing what they want)
- Project root (path)

## Process

**First, re-evaluate the documentation manifest's tripwires.** Every
not-applicable row in the documentation profile carries a `revisit when`
predicate. Check each one against the project as it is now and lead the report
with the ones firing: a document correctly skipped last quarter that the code now
requires is the reason to run reconciliation a second time, and it is invisible to
every other check here. Report a predicate that is true now, not one being
watched. A fired tripwire is a finding with a named document and the signal that
tripped it, never a general suggestion to review the docs.

Then, for each artifact below, check (in parallel where possible):

### Tier 1 artifacts

#### PRD (`.godpowers/prd/PRD.mdx`)
- Is the requirement explicitly listed? (grep functional/non-functional sections)
- Is it implied but not specific? (semantic similarity)
- Verdict: present / missing / ambiguous
- If missing: recommend `/god-redo prd` or accept divergence with audit

#### ARCH (`.godpowers/arch/ARCH.mdx` + `adr/`)
- Does the feature need a new component in C4 diagrams?
- Does it cross a new trust boundary?
- Does any existing ADR need a flip-point review?
- Does it change an NFR (latency, scale, security)?
- Verdict: covered / needs-delta / needs-new-adr / unchanged
- If needs-delta: recommend `/god-arch` in delta-only mode

#### ROADMAP (`.godpowers/roadmap/ROADMAP.mdx`)
- Already-done / in-progress / enhancement / prerequisite-needed / new / ambiguous
- Use the integrated ROADMAP classification logic for milestone overlap.

#### STACK (`.godpowers/stack/DECISION.mdx`)
- Does the feature require a new dependency category? (e.g., adding a queue when none exists)
- Does it change a flip point? (e.g., choice now needs to handle new scale)
- Verdict: covered / needs-addition / changes-flip-point
- If needs-addition: recommend updating DECISION.md and reviewing pairings

### Tier 2 artifacts

#### REPO (`.godpowers/repo/AUDIT.mdx`)
- Does the feature need a new top-level folder?
- New lint rule for the new code path?
- New CI step?
- Verdict: scaffolded / needs-extension

#### BUILD state
- Is there an active build wave?
- Will this feature add to current PLAN.md or require a new build cycle?
- Verdict: pause-needed / can-append / fresh-build

### Tier 3 artifacts

#### DEPLOY state evidence

Source: `.godpowers/state.json` `tier-3.deploy`.
- Does the feature need a new env var?
- New deploy step (e.g., new service)?
- Verdict: covered / needs-extension

#### OBSERVE state evidence

Source: `.godpowers/state.json` `tier-3.observe`.
- Does the feature need a new SLO?
- New error budget category?
- New alert + runbook?
- Verdict: covered / needs-slo / needs-alert

#### HARDEN (`.godpowers/harden/FINDINGS.mdx`)
- Does the feature add a new attack surface?
- New auth boundary to test?
- New input source to validate?
- Verdict: covered / needs-review / new-surface

#### LAUNCH state evidence

Source: `.godpowers/state.json` `tier-3.launch`.
- Is the feature user-visible?
- Does launch copy need updating?
- New channel-specific messaging needed?
- Verdict: invisible-feature / copy-update / new-launch

### Capture artifacts

#### BACKLOG (`.godpowers/backlog/BACKLOG.mdx`)
- Does an existing backlog entry match this intent?
- Verdict: not-captured / already-captured (with entry reference)

#### SEEDS (`.godpowers/seeds/`)
- Does this work trigger a planted seed's condition?
- Verdict: no-seeds / triggers-seed (with seed ID)

#### TODOS (`.godpowers/todos/TODOS.mdx`)
- Does an open todo relate to this?
- Verdict: no-related / supersedes-todo / relates-to-todo

#### THREADS (`.godpowers/threads/`)
- Is there an active thread about this topic?
- Verdict: no-thread / active-thread (with thread name)

### Runtime and repository surface artifacts

#### REPO DOCS (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE.md`, docs, support files)
- Does this work change public counts, badges, release status, install
  guidance, contributor guidance, or support policy?
- Verdict: fresh / needs-mechanical-sync / needs-docs-writer
- If narrative release or support docs need judgment: recommend
  `god-docs-writer`.

#### REPO SURFACE (`skills/`, `agents/`, `routing/`, `workflows/`, `schema/`, `package.json`)
- Did the work add, rename, remove, or change a command, agent, workflow,
  recipe, schema, package file entry, extension, or release helper?
- Verdict: fresh / needs-surface-sync / needs-safe-fix / needs-human-review
- If stale checks are mechanical: recommend `lib/repo-surface-sync.run`.

#### FEATURE AWARENESS (`.godpowers/state.json`, context fences)
- Does an existing Godpowers project need to learn about new runtime features?
- Verdict: fresh / needs-awareness-refresh / needs-migration-judgment
- If imported planning systems have low confidence or conflicts: recommend
  `god-greenfieldifier`.

#### SOURCE SYSTEM SYNC-BACK (legacy planning, BMAD, Superpowers, godplans, godaudits)
- Did migrated source-system summaries need managed sync-back?
- For godplans/godaudits, sync-back writes only the managed
  `.godplans/GODPOWERS-SYNC.mdx` or `.godaudits/GODPOWERS-SYNC.mdx`
  companion; PLAN.mdx, AUDIT.json, and generated AUDIT.mdx are never edited by
  this flow.
- Verdict: not-applicable / fresh / needs-sync-back / blocked-by-conflict
- If conflicts exist: recommend greenfieldifier review before writes.

#### SIBLING PLAN (`.godplans/PLAN.mdx`)
- Does `.godplans/validate-plan.sh` complete the pinned Godplans 1.1 contract,
  and is lifecycle status eligible for execution? Inspect read-only through
  `lib/sibling-artifacts.loadPlan`.
- Does the intent match an existing GP task in the plan?
- Verdict: not-applicable / contract-incomplete / awaiting-approval / closed /
  planned-in-godplans (with GP id) / not-in-plan / plan-conflict
- Only `ready-for-validator` may recommend execution, and its action must run
  `bash .godplans/validate-plan.sh .godplans/PLAN.mdx` before the GP task.
- If plan-conflict: the plan is authored intent; surface the GP/R id and ask
  the user before proceeding.

#### SIBLING AUDIT (`.godaudits/AUDIT.json`, legacy MDX fallback)
- Does the intent address or invalidate an open GA remediation task or F
  finding? (read-only)
- Verdict: not-applicable / addresses-ga-task (with GA id) / invalidates-finding
  (with F id) / unrelated
- If it addresses a GA task: recommend routing through `/god-fix GA-<n>` so
  the finding's Verify command becomes the done-check.

#### HOST CAPABILITY (`lib/host-capabilities.js`)
- Does the work depend on a host feature such as fresh-context spawning,
  local shell, GitHub CLI, npm, or extension authoring?
- Verdict: full / degraded / unknown
- If degraded: include the missing guarantee in the recommendation.

### Blocking sync conflicts (safe-sync plan)

When the checks above surface cross-artifact conflicts that contradict each
other (for example ROADMAP marks a milestone shipped that the PRD dropped, or
deploy evidence references a service the ARCH removed) and shipping on top of
them would make Tier 3 claims false, write
`.godpowers/sync/SAFE-SYNC-PLAN.mdx` before returning:

- one entry per conflict: the artifacts involved, the contradiction, and the
  evidence line for each side
- concrete resolution steps per conflict (which artifact to change, or which
  command runs the fix)

This file is a gate. `lib/router.js` blocks /god-deploy, /god-observe,
/god-harden, /god-launch, and /god-mode Tier 3 work through the
`safe-sync-clear` prerequisite until /god-reconcile verifies the resolutions
and writes `.godpowers/sync/SAFE-SYNC-RESOLVED.mdx`. Do NOT write the plan
for ordinary non-blocking drift; report that through the normal per-artifact
verdicts. Report the plan path and each conflict in the returned verdict so
the caller can tell the user why Tier 3 is blocked.

## Decision tree the user sees

After reconciliation, present:

```
Reconciliation: <intent>

Where this intersects existing artifacts:
  PRD:        MISSING - need to add requirement
  ARCH:       NEEDS DELTA - new component, new ADR
  ROADMAP:    ENHANCEMENT - fold into Milestone 2
  STACK:      covered
  REPO:       scaffolded
  DEPLOY:     needs new env var
  OBSERVE:    needs SLO for new endpoint
  HARDEN:     needs scope-to-new-code review
  LAUNCH:     update landing copy
  BACKLOG:    already captured: "team collaboration features"
  SEEDS:      no triggers
  TODOS:      supersedes "refactor auth middleware"
  THREADS:    relates to active thread "auth migration"
  REPO DOCS:  needs mechanical sync
  SURFACE:    needs repo-surface sync
  FEATURES:   awareness refresh needed
  SOURCE:     no sync-back needed
  PLAN:       planned in godplans as GP-204
  AUDIT:      addresses open GA-102 (F-SEC-3)
  HOST:       degraded - fresh-context agent spawn not detected
  SYNC GATE:  clear (or: BLOCKING - plan at .godpowers/sync/SAFE-SYNC-PLAN.mdx)

Recommended sequence:
  1. /god-redo prd            (add requirement)
  2. /god-arch delta-only     (architecture delta)
  3. /god-feature             (build it, scoped to Milestone 2)
  4. /god-sync                (update all touched artifacts and local sync surfaces)

Run this sequence? (yes / show alternatives / cancel)
```

## Missing artifacts (graceful handling)

Not every artifact exists in every project. Tier 1-3 artifacts get created
during the project run (`/god-mode` produces 10 of them). Capture artifacts
(BACKLOG, SEEDS, TODOS, THREADS) are lazy: they only exist if the user
has used those commands.

When an artifact file does NOT exist, return:

```json
{
  "<artifact>": { "status": "not-yet-created", "action": "(none; will be created if reconciliation says so)" }
}
```

Example: in a fresh `/god-mode` run that just finished Tier 1 PRD, only
PRD.md exists. ARCH/ROADMAP/etc. are not-yet-created. Don't fail; report
honestly.

This is the "greenfield-aware" behavior: reconciler works correctly at
every project stage, not just steady state.

## When to skip reconciliation

The orchestrator should skip this agent for:

- `/god-fast` (trivial)
- `/god-quick` (small task)
- `/god-debug` (not a new feature)
- `/god-hotfix` (urgent; reconcile after, in postmortem)
- Recipes in non-feature-addition categories

For feature-addition category recipes: ALWAYS reconcile.

## Have-Nots

Reconciliation FAILS if:
- Returns "all covered" without checking each artifact
- Skips an artifact silently (must report status for each)
- Finds blocking cross-artifact sync conflicts but does not write
  `.godpowers/sync/SAFE-SYNC-PLAN.mdx` (the Tier 3 gate never engages)
- Writes SAFE-SYNC-PLAN.mdx for ordinary non-blocking drift (gate spam)
- Skips repo docs, repo surface, feature awareness, source sync-back, or host
  capability when the work affects them
- Recommends bypass without justification
- Does not re-evaluate documentation-manifest tripwires, so a not-applicable row
  that the project has outgrown stays not-applicable forever
- Buries a fired tripwire below routine drift instead of leading with it
- Missing prerequisite check
- Doesn't surface ambiguous cases
- Wrong synthesis (e.g., says "new" when ROADMAP shows enhancement)
