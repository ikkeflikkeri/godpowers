# Godpowers Reference

Complete command, agent, and artifact reference for v5.16.0.

**This page is a dictionary, not a tutorial.** It lists everything, which makes
it useful for looking things up and a poor place to start. If you are new, read
[Getting Started](getting-started.md) first, or just type `/god` and describe
what you want in plain English.

Nobody uses all of this. Most people use six or seven commands and let
`/god-next` suggest the rest when they become relevant.

## Slash commands (123 total)

The 123 total is 122 `god-*` commands plus the `/god` natural-language front
door (a thin router that classifies intent rather than doing work itself).

### Command families

Commands are grouped into families so the list stays scannable.
All 123 commands remain direct entry points, but the user-facing map starts
with likely next moves and families:

| Family | Purpose |
|---|---|
| start | Start or import a project. |
| continue | Understand state and choose the next move. |
| build | Plan, implement, test, and ship product work. |
| verify | Check artifacts, code, runtime behavior, and release readiness. |
| operate | Deploy, observe, harden, launch, and respond in production. |
| maintain | Keep artifacts, docs, dependencies, context, and repo surfaces current. |
| capture | Save thoughts, tasks, backlog items, seeds, and learnings. |
| recover | Undo, repair, restore, skip, or diagnose broken state. |
| extend | Install, inspect, test, remove, or author extension packs. |
| collaborate | Coordinate people, workstreams, suites, sprints, and pull requests. |
| configure | Tune settings, budgets, cache, profiles, help, and version info. |

`/god-help` shows a compact state-aware view. `/god-help <family>` shows the
matching leaf commands. `/god-help all` shows the full catalog.

### Decision ladders

Some intents are ambiguous by nature. "Capture this" could mean four different
things, and "build it" depends entirely on how big "it" is. For these, Godpowers
picks the smallest command that fits rather than making you choose:

| Intent | Ladder |
|---|---|
| Capture | `/god-note`, `/god-add-todo`, `/god-add-backlog`, `/god-plant-seed` |
| Work size | `/god-fast`, `/god-quick`, `/god-story`, `/god-feature`, `/god-build`, `/god-debug`, `/god-hotfix` |
| Verification | `/god-lint`, `/god-standards`, `/god-review`, `/god-test-runtime`, `/god-audit`, `/god-hygiene`, `/god-preflight`, `/god-dogfood` |

### Verb dispatchers
The default `core` install starts with first-run guidance, the front door,
surface control, and verb dispatchers: `/god-first-run`, `/god-demo`, `/god`,
`/god-surface`, `/god-init`, `/god-plan`, `/god-build`, `/god-fix`,
`/god-ship`, `/god-sync`, and `/god-undo`. These commands route to existing leaf
commands through routing metadata and do not remove direct shortcuts from the
`full` profile.

`/god-status` is the continue hub. `/god-progress`, `/god-status --lifecycle`,
`/god-status --locate`, and `/god-next` remain direct shortcuts for narrower
views. `/god-lifecycle` and `/god-locate` remain full-profile deprecated
compatibility aliases for one minor release.

### Installer profile journeys
Profiles reduce the installed command surface without changing runtime
behavior:

| Journey | Profile |
|---|---|
| I want the basics | `core` |
| I build products | `builder` |
| I maintain Godpowers or mature repos | `maintainer` |
| I coordinate suites | `suite` |
| I want everything | `full` |

### Surface discipline
New commands should not be the default response to a usability gap. First try a
family card, decision ladder, profile journey, recipe, typed route outcome, or
documentation change. Add a new public command only when a case study, canary,
or repeated user journey proves that existing paths cannot express the need.
[DECISION] Phase 5 uses [Surface Contraction Evidence](surface-contraction.md)
to map proof-campaign command usage after installer defaults changed.

### Outcome metrics
Quick Proof and adoption canary reports track commands to first signal, next
command, missing artifacts, host gaps, and whether status plus next produce
recommendation signals. Longer runs use `/god-metrics`, `/god-trace`, and
`/god-cost` for duration, pauses, retries, and cost.

### Front door
- `/god` - Free-text intent matcher. Maps to a recipe and proposes the right command.
- `/god-first-run` - Guide the first 10 minutes with one recommendation at a time.
- `/god-demo` - Run the shipped sandbox proof without modifying the current project.
- `/god-next` - Pre-flight + post-flight routing. Suggests next command from state.
- `/god-status` - Re-derive project state from disk.
- `/god-status --lifecycle` - Show project phase and fitting workflows.
- `/god-status --locate` - Orient a fresh AI session from checkpoint, handoff, and disk evidence.
- `/god-progress` - Deliverable progress: which requirements and roadmap increments are done, in progress, or not started. Refreshes `.godpowers/REQUIREMENTS.mdx`.
- `/god-plan` - Route planning intent to PRD, design, architecture, roadmap, stack, or reconstruction.
- `/god-fix` - Route bug and outage intent to debug or hotfix. Picks up unresolved findings from an audit report on disk (`.godaudits/AUDIT.json`) as typed remediation tasks.
- `/god-ship` - Route shipping intent to deploy, observe, or launch.
- `/god-capture` - Route notes, todos, backlog items, and seeds.
- `/god-extend` - Route extension authoring, install, inspection, removal, and testing.
- `/god-automation-status` - Show host automation provider support.
- `/god-automation-setup` - Prepare opt-in automation setup.
- `/god-surface` - Preview or apply a runtime command surface profile after install.
- `/god-migrate` - Detect work another tool already left on disk (a plan, an audit report, or context from an earlier workflow such as BMAD, Superpowers, or Arc-Ready), import it as seeds, and sync progress back.

### Installer CLI helpers
- `godpowers status --project .` - Render the shared dashboard from disk state.
- `godpowers next --project .` - Render the dashboard and show the recommended next command.
- `godpowers quick-proof --project .` - Render the shipped proof fixture with host guarantees; the project path scopes host detection, not fixture evidence.
- `godpowers quick-proof --project . --inspect-project` - Inspect current-project state explicitly through a read-only proof view.
- `godpowers state advance --step=prd --status=done --project .` - Update one tracked state step and regenerate managed state views.
- `godpowers gate --tier=prd --project .` - Check a tier artifact gate and exit non-zero when blocking evidence is missing.
- `godpowers verify "<cmd>" --substep tier-2.build --claim "<claim>" --project .` - Run a command as executed verification: append an exit-code-backed record to `.godpowers/ledger/verifications.jsonl`, roll the latest verdict into `state.json` `verification.commands[]`, emit `gate.pass`/`gate.fail`, and exit non-zero when the command fails. Use `--attest --claim "<claim>" --evidence "<text>"` to record a self-reported attestation instead.
- `godpowers can-close --substep tier-2.build --project .` - Read-only check of the strict close gate (`evidence.canClose`): exit zero only when the substep has the evidence to close (executable-gated tiers need a passing executed record since they went in-flight; other tiers accept an attested record). Used by the orchestrator before advancing a substep to done.
- `godpowers route "<prompt>" --project .` - Quarterback entry router (read-only). Classifies the prompt into a play (recover, resume, recovery, brownfield, research, review, full, feature, or trivial) with a next command, ceremony level, and verification strategy. Refuses new work on a red latest verdict or unresolved Critical findings, and right-sizes ceremony so a one-line fix does not open an arc.
- `godpowers report --since last --project .` - Verification play-by-play from the evidence ledger since the last report, with an Attention section for unverified records. Advances a report cursor at `.godpowers/ledger/reports/cursor.json` unless `--peek` is given. Use `--since all` for the full history.
- `godpowers reflect --action "<what was attempted>" --outcome success|partial|failure --observation "<what happened>" --next "<next action>" [--root-cause "<cause>"] [--lesson "<lesson>"] [--substep <id>] --project .` - Record a structured reflection to `.godpowers/ledger/reflections.jsonl` after a significant action or failure, so course corrections rest on recorded observations.
- `godpowers memory set|get|list|clear [<key>] [<value>] [--category fact|decision|discovery|state] --project .` - Read and write durable key/value memory at `.godpowers/ledger/memory.json`. `set` upserts a key, `get` reads one, `list` shows all (optionally by category), and `clear` removes a key or all entries.
- `godpowers lesson add|list "<lesson>" [--tags a,b] [--scope project|global] --project .` - Record or list reusable lessons. `add` appends to `.godpowers/ledger/lessons.jsonl` (or `~/.godpowers/lessons.jsonl` with `--scope global`); a reflection with a lesson auto-records one tagged `auto-reflected`.
- `godpowers event emit <name> [--attrs '{"k":"v"}'] [--run <run-id>] --project .` - Emit a `lesson.*` or `proposal.*` event to the hash-chained run ledger; the emission surface for skill prose. Restricted to those two families on purpose: `change.*`, `gate.*`, and `state.rollback` feed ledger-derived metrics and cannot be self-reported. Without `--run` a fresh single-event run is started; pass the first emission's run id back via `--run` to keep one session's events in one run.
- `godpowers proposal propose|list|decide [<id>] [--file spec.json] [--status open|decided|accepted|rejected] [--reason "<text>"] --project .` - Human-gated prompt-change proposals (`lib/improvement-proposals.js`). `propose --file` drafts from a `{ targetFile, rationale, patchText }` spec, writes `.godpowers/proposals/<id>.json`, and escalates a warning-severity review item; `list` shows open and decided records; `decide <id> --status=accepted|rejected` records the human verdict from `/god-review-changes`, refuses stale accepts, and moves the record to `decided/`. The CLI never applies a patch.
- `godpowers outcome start|check|stop|status <name> [--goal "<text>"] [--verify "<cmd>"] [--budget N] [--substep <id>] [--reason "<text>"] --project .` - Bounded retry loop at `.godpowers/ledger/outcomes/<slug>/`. `start` sets a goal, verifier, and budget; `check` runs the verifier (recording the executed verdict to the main ledger too), appends an iteration, and marks the outcome succeeded, failed (budget exhausted), or still active; `stop` ends it; `status` shows the goal and iterations.
- `godpowers import-ledger [--from <path to .mythify>] --project .` - One-time, best-effort import of an existing Mythify `.mythify/` ledger into `.godpowers/ledger/`: verifications (rebinding plan/step to arc/substep), reflections, memory, lessons, and outcomes. Records are appended; no state rollup and no gate events.
- `godpowers mcp-info --project .` - Show read-only MCP companion setup instructions without loading the MCP SDK.
- `godpowers automation-status --project .` - Show automation provider support.
- `godpowers automation-setup --project .` - Show a reviewed setup and execution plan.
- `godpowers dogfood` - Run built-in messy-repo dogfood scenarios.
- `godpowers demo --project .` - Show the shipped sandbox proof.
- `godpowers surface --profile=builder --codex --global --dry-run` - Preview a runtime surface profile switch.
- `godpowers surface --profile=builder --codex --global --apply` - Apply a runtime surface profile switch.
- `godpowers extension-scaffold --name=@scope/pack --output=.` - Create a publishable extension pack skeleton.
- `godpowers status --project . --brief` - Render only the action brief, host guarantee, status, and next route.
- `godpowers status --project . --json` - Emit machine-readable dashboard state.
- `npx godpowers --profile=core|builder|maintainer|suite|full` - Install a smaller role-specific slash-command surface.
- `npx godpowers --minimal` - Install the `core` profile.

Dashboard status uses workflow progress from `.godpowers/state.json` tracked
steps. Audit, hygiene, remediation, and launch-readiness scores are separate
metrics and should be labeled separately in closeouts.

### MCP companion
`@godpowers/mcp` is an optional first-party companion package. It owns the MCP
SDK dependency, while the main `godpowers` package remains dependency-free at
runtime.

The companion exposes nine read-only tools: `status`, `next`, `gate_check`,
`lint_artifact`, `trace_requirement`, `work_report`, `change_metrics`, `route`,
and `verification_history`. Mutating tools such as state advance, verify,
artifact writes, and route edits are intentionally absent; external write
actions are delegated to host connectors via `/god-connect`, so the MCP surface
stays read-only and verification stays on the CLI and orchestrator path.

Run `godpowers mcp-info --project .` for host setup instructions. Codex
registration is written only when `godpowers-mcp setup --host=codex --project=. --write` is invoked explicitly.

Build and review commands enforce request-trace discipline. Executors state
assumptions, public behavior, expected files, and verification before editing.
Reviewers block scope creep, speculative flexibility, unrelated cleanup, and
diff churn that cannot be traced to the request or slice plan.

## Project context files

Godpowers keeps durable project truth in files rather than in the chat, so any
command in any session starts from the same facts. The layout follows
[Pillars](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/pillars), an open convention for
structuring those files; a "pillar" is one of the per-area notes below. You do
not install anything for this, and the files are plain markdown you can edit.

The point of splitting them by area is that a command loads only what its task
needs. A database migration reads `agents/data.md`; it does not pay the context
cost of the deploy or UI notes.

Commands load `agents/context.md` and `agents/repo.md` in every applicable
scope, then route task-specific files with the portable matcher from the Pillars
1.1 spec. A file may declare direct `must_read_with` dependencies, loaded one
level deep. `see_also` targets load only when their own identity, triggers, or
covers match the task.

```
AGENTS.md              Loading protocol plus the Godpowers managed fence
agents/catalog.yaml    Optional local inventory of known absent concerns
agents/context.md      Always-loaded project identity and invariants
agents/repo.md         Always-loaded repository layout and naming
agents/stack.md        Technology choices and version constraints
agents/arch.md         System boundaries and architecture decisions
agents/data.md         Data model, migrations, queries, and storage
agents/api.md          API contracts and request/response shapes
agents/ui.md           Visual UI, components, and design tokens
agents/auth.md         Identity, sessions, roles, and access control
agents/quality.md      Testing, errors, style, and naming
agents/deploy.md       Environments, promotion, rollback, and release process
agents/observe.md      Logs, metrics, tracing, alerts, and runbooks
agents/<area>/*.md     Path-qualified sub-files such as auth/registration
```

A monorepo can nest these: any directory containing both `AGENTS.md` and
`agents/` is its own scope. Godpowers loads outer scopes first, applies the
nearest scope last, and respects local exclusions. The repository release gate
runs the Pillars project's own routing fixtures, so this stays compatible with
the published spec rather than drifting into a private dialect.

Existing `.godpowers` projects gain these files on resume and sync. Current
Godpowers artifacts become managed source references in the relevant pillar
files, with labeled decisions, hypotheses, and open questions extracted when
available.

## CLI

Install, profile switching, and read-only helper commands. Slash commands
remain the primary project workflow surface.

```
npx godpowers --claude --global    Install for Claude Code
npx godpowers --all                Install for all 15 runtimes
npx godpowers surface --profile=core --codex --global --dry-run
npx godpowers demo --project=.
npx godpowers status --project=.
npx godpowers verify "npm test" --substep tier-2.build --claim "tests pass" --project=.
npx godpowers --uninstall          Remove
npx godpowers --migrate            One-shot upgrade
npx godpowers --help               Help
```

Supported runtimes (15): Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, OpenCode,
Copilot, Augment, Trae, Cline, Kilo, Antigravity, Qwen, CodeBuddy, Pi.
T3 Code inherits from the underlying agent (Codex / Claude / OpenCode).

Codex installs include matching `god-*.toml` metadata beside each
`agents/god-*.md` file so specialist agents can be exposed as spawnable Codex
agent types when the runtime reloads its agent registry.

Spawning is platform-neutral at the skill layer. Commands say to spawn the
named `god-*` specialist through the host platform's native agent mechanism.
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, OpenCode, Copilot, Augment,
Trae, Cline, Kilo, Antigravity, Qwen, CodeBuddy, and Pi may expose that
mechanism differently. The installed Markdown agent contract is the portable
source; Codex TOML is the adapter for Codex's registry.
