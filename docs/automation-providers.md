# Automation Providers

Godpowers can run on a schedule, using whatever scheduling your AI tool already
provides. This page explains which tools can do it and how well.

**Nothing is scheduled without you asking.** Installing Godpowers puts support
files on disk and stops there. It does not create schedules, routines,
background agents, API triggers, CI workflows, commits, pushes, releases, npm
publishes, deployments, or provider-dashboard checks. Automation is opt-in, one
choice at a time.

## Provider Classes

Scheduling means different things in different tools, and the differences
matter. A "schedule" that dies when you close your laptop is not the same
product as one that runs on someone else's server.

| Class | Providers | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| native-scheduler | Codex App, Claude Routines, Cline schedules, Kilo scheduled triggers | Durable schedules owned by the host platform |
| session-scheduler | Qwen Code `/loop` | Recurs while the current session is alive |
| background-agent | Cursor Background Agents, GitHub Copilot cloud agent | Async branch or PR work in a managed environment |
| scriptable-headless | Gemini CLI, OpenCode, CodeBuddy SDK, Pi SDK | Can be run by an approved external scheduler |
| manual-workflow | Windsurf workflows, Augment subagents | Reusable workflow or agent surface, not durable scheduling |
| unknown | Trae, Antigravity scheduled automation | Report capability as unknown until the host proves support |

## Commands

Use these slash commands inside an AI coding tool:

```text
/god-automation-status
/god-automation-setup
```

Use these CLI helpers from a shell, CI, or host runtime:

```bash
godpowers automation-status --project .
godpowers automation-setup --project .
godpowers automation-status --project . --json
```

The CLI commands do not call an LLM and do not create host automations. They
return deterministic provider and setup-plan data that Claude, Codex, Cursor,
CI, or another host can consume.

Inside an AI host, `/god-automation-setup` may use the host's native tool
calling after explicit approval. Simple read-only setup can use a direct host
tool or native command. Complex setup is delegated to `god-automation-engineer`
so the host-specific steps, verification, and state recording happen in a
fresh context.

## Safe Templates

The first supported templates are read-only:

- `daily-status`: summarize current phase, progress, open items, and next action
- `stale-checkpoint`: report stale or missing checkpoint state
- `review-queue`: report pending review items without clearing them
- `weekly-hygiene`: report docs, dependency, checkpoint, review, and hygiene signals
- `release-readiness`: report release readiness without publishing

## State File

Created automations should be recorded in `.godpowers/automations.json` only
after the host setup succeeds.

```json
{
  "automations": [
    {
      "id": "daily-status",
      "provider": "codex-app",
      "status": "active",
      "cadence": "daily at 9am",
      "summary": "Read-only Godpowers dashboard report",
      "createdAt": "2026-05-16T00:00:00.000Z",
      "host": "Codex App"
    }
  ]
}
```

Disk state remains authoritative. If `.godpowers/automations.json` says an
automation exists but the host no longer has it, `/god-automation-status` must
report drift and recommend repair instead of pretending the automation is live.

## Execution Contract

`lib/automation-providers.js` exposes:

- `setupPlan(projectRoot, opts)`: provider, selected templates, and execution
  path for the current host
- `renderSetupPlan(plan)`: human-readable approval plan
- `buildAutomationRecord(providerId, templateId, opts)`: state record builder
- `recordAutomation(projectRoot, record, { confirmedHostSuccess: true })`:
  state writer gated on confirmed host success

The host workflow is:

1. Render the setup plan.
2. Ask for exact approval.
3. Use direct host tool calling only when the plan says it is available.
4. Spawn `god-automation-engineer` for multi-template, write-capable,
   background-agent, scriptable-scheduler, or uncertain setup.
5. Record the automation only after the provider reports success.
6. Re-run `/god-automation-status`.

## Safety Rules

- Do not create automations during install.
- Ask before creating, updating, triggering, pausing, resuming, or deleting
  any provider-native automation.
- Ask before granting connectors, repository write access, branch-push scope,
  API trigger tokens, or dashboard access.
- Read-only templates may report state, but they must not change state.
- Write-capable automations must be branch or PR scoped by default.
- Merge, deploy, publish, release, npm publish, production launch, review
  clearing, and Critical security acceptance stay human-approved.
