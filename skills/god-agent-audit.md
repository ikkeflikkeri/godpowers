description: |
  Validates every `specialists/god-*.md` source contract:
  required frontmatter, structured contract frontmatter, recommended
  sections (Have-Nots, Inputs, Outputs, Handoff), hand-off targets exist,
  no dual-ownership of output paths. Lenient by design: most issues are
  warnings; only structural breakage errors.

# /god-agent-audit

Mechanical validation of agent contracts. Backed by `lib/agent-validator.js`.

## Forms

| Form | Action |
|---|---|
| `/god-agent-audit` | Default human-readable report |
| `/god-agent-audit --json` | Structured JSON output |
| `/god-agent-audit --errors-only` | Skip warnings and infos |
| `/god-agent-audit --fix` | Append placeholder for missing recommended sections (info-level only) |

## What gets checked

**Required (errors)**:
- Frontmatter `name` field
- Frontmatter `description` field

**Recommended (warnings)**:
- Frontmatter `tools` field
- Frontmatter `inputs`, `outputs`, `gates`, and `handoff` fields after at least 20 shipped agents have structured contracts
- Hand-off targets that are referenced exist as agent files
- Output paths claimed by 4+ agents (boundary review needed)

**Recommended (info)**:
- Each agent should have these sections somewhere:
  - "Have-Nots" (or equivalent failure list)
  - "Inputs" (what it reads)
  - "Outputs" (what it writes)
  - "Handoff" (where it returns / what it spawns)

The info-level suggestions are non-blocking. They surface as polish
opportunities, not failures.

## Output

```
Agent audit

41 agents audited
41 structured contracts
0 errors, 1 warning, 97 infos

Errors:
(none)

Warnings:
  [multi-ownership] .godpowers/state.json claimed by 5 agents (verify boundaries)

Infos: 97 missing-recommended-section suggestions across agents
       (run with --json for full list)

Next commands:
- /god-agent-audit --fix: Fix the highest-priority approved agent contract issue.
- /god-agent-audit --fix for info-level placeholder sections only: Run the full recommended path.
- /god-discuss agent contract findings: Resolve the open question before continuing.
- /god-agent-audit --json: Inspect details before changing files.
```

## Backward-compatibility promise

This skill never breaks existing agents that don't yet have the
recommended sections. Errors fire only on real structural issues
(missing required frontmatter, broken hand-off targets, conflicting
output ownership). Missing structured contract frontmatter becomes a
warning once a project has at least 20 agents with complete `inputs`,
`outputs`, `gates`, and `handoff` fields.

The `--fix` flag inserts placeholder sections so contributors can
fill them in incrementally. It never modifies content that's already
present.

## Integration

`/god-agent-audit` is part of the standard test suite (npm test).
Agent contract violations become regression failures: contracts can
only get tighter over time, not looser.
