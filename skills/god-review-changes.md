  Walk REVIEW-REQUIRED.md interactively. Surface each pending review
  with affected files and suggested actions. Mark items as addressed
  to clear them from the pending list.

# /god-review-changes

Walk through pending review items in `REVIEW-REQUIRED.md` one batch at
a time. For each: show what changed, which files are affected, propose
remediation, and let the user mark addressed (or defer).

## Forms

| Form | Action |
|---|---|
| `/god-review-changes` | Walk all batches interactively |
| `/god-review-changes --list` | List all pending items, no action |
| `/god-review-changes --clear` | Clear `REVIEW-REQUIRED.md` (only if empty or after explicit confirm) |
| `/god-review-changes --json` | Output structured JSON, no interaction |

## Process

1. Read `REVIEW-REQUIRED.md` via `lib/review-required.readEntries`.
2. If empty: report "No pending reviews."
3. For each batch, surface:
   - Batch ID, source, summary, timestamp
   - Each item with severity, ID, file path, message, suggestion
4. For each item, ask: address now / defer / mark resolved.
5. If addressed: open the affected file(s) for editing.
6. After all items in a batch are addressed: prompt to clear the batch.
7. After all batches cleared: delete `REVIEW-REQUIRED.md`.

## Improvement proposals

Batches with source `improvement-proposal` carry a drafted prompt-surface
change (a `skills/`, `specialists/`, or `references/` file) that the learning
loop escalated instead of applying (`lib/improvement-proposals.js`). For each
proposal item:

1. Read the proposal record the suggestion points at
   (`.godpowers/proposals/<id>.json`): target file, rationale, patch text.
2. Check staleness first: if the target changed since drafting, the proposal
   must be rejected or re-drafted, never applied
   (`proposal decide <id> --status=rejected --reason="stale"` refuses stale
   accepts mechanically too).
3. Show the human the target, the rationale, and the full patch. "Address
   now" here means the human explicitly approves the change BEFORE any edit
   happens.
4. On approval: apply the patch to the target file in-session (the human's
   edit), run the project test suite, then record the verdict:
   `npx godpowers proposal decide <id> --status=accepted --reason="..."`.
   On rejection: `--status=rejected` with the reason. Either verdict emits
   `proposal.accepted` / `proposal.rejected` and moves the record to
   `.godpowers/proposals/decided/`.
5. The decide step removes only that proposal's queue item
   (`reviewRequired.removeItem`); other pending batches stay byte-identical,
   so resolving a proposal can never drop someone else's pending review.

Never batch-approve proposals; each one is read, tested, and decided on its
own.

## Auto-clear policy

Per plan question 3: REVIEW-REQUIRED.md does NOT auto-clear under
--yolo. Clearing requires either:
- Walking through and marking items
- Explicit `--clear` flag with confirmation

This forces the user to look at what changed, which is the whole point
of the artifact.

## Integration with linkage

When showing "affected files," this skill cross-references
`lib/linkage.queryByFile(projectRoot, file)` so the user sees which
artifact IDs that file is linked to. Helps decide what to fix.

## Proactive invocation

Godpowers should suggest this skill automatically when
`REVIEW-REQUIRED.md` gains pending entries from reverse-sync, design impact,
runtime verification, docs drift, or security-sensitive changes.

Default behavior is suggestion only:

```text
Proactive checks:
  Reviews: <N> pending, suggest /god-review-changes
```

Do not auto-run the interactive walkthrough unless the user asks to address
the pending items now. Do not auto-clear review items under default mode or
`--yolo`.

## Output

```
/god-review-changes

3 pending batches in REVIEW-REQUIRED.md:

Batch 1: Design token change
  Source: design-impact
  Timestamp: 2026-05-10T14:23:11Z
  Summary: colors.primary darkened; affects 3 files

  Items (3):
    [WARNING] [colors.primary] src/components/Button.tsx: token value changed
       Linked to: D-button-primary
       Suggestion: review computed contrast on Button against background

    [WARNING] [colors.primary] src/components/Header.tsx: token value changed
       Linked to: D-header
       Suggestion: review header hierarchy

    [WARNING] [colors.primary] src/styles/globals.css: token value changed
       Linked to: (style file)
       Suggestion: re-render visual regression test

Address now / defer / mark resolved? [a/d/r]
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- Modify any artifact (DESIGN.md, PRD.md, etc.)
- Run lint or impeccable (those are separate skills)
- Run reverse-sync (god-updater on /god-sync)
- Auto-fix any issue (always requires human review)
- Apply an improvement proposal the human has not explicitly approved in the
  walkthrough (and never a stale one)

## Output

Updates `REVIEW-REQUIRED.md` (clearing addressed items). No other
artifact changes.
