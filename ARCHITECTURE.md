# Godpowers Architecture (v3 Design Target)

> Status: STABLE v5.14.1 published release (Godplans 1.1 two-artifact contracts, lifecycle-safe dispatch, complete GP and requirement traceability, and the existing production runtime surface)
> Authors: Godpowers Team
> Last updated: 2026-07-13

This document is the canonical design for Godpowers as a coherent product.
v4.0.0 preserves the v3.0.0 surface contraction: the omitted installer profile
is `core`, first-run and demo commands guide safer onboarding, surface control
can preview or apply runtime profiles after install, verb dispatchers route to
existing leaf commands,
`.godpowers/state.json` remains the state authority, markdown state files stay
generated human views, Codex host-run proof studies remain public evidence,
installed-runtime and build-gate fixes stay in the release gate, and the
optional read-only MCP companion package stays outside the dependency-free main
runtime.
Auto-invoked commands, spawned agents, local runtime helpers, platform-specific
spawning limits, migration imports, sync-back writes, feature-awareness
refreshes, repo documentation sync, repo surface sync, quick proof runs,
dogfood runs, canary reports, and dashboard progress must be reported visibly
instead of implied as hidden background work.

The design follows a **pure-skill model**: Godpowers is a skill-based system.
The CLI surface is `npx godpowers` for installation plus read-only proof,
status, next-route, tier-gate, MCP setup info, dogfood, extension-scaffold, and
automation-provider helpers. Durable project operations remain slash commands
inside the AI coding tool.

The design is informed by research into how mature dev tools (GitHub Actions,
Tekton, Argo, Buildkite, VSCode, Cargo, Poetry, Bazel, Nx, Helm, Terraform,
Flyway, OpenTelemetry, Git, Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK) solve the problems
Godpowers needs to solve. See `docs/RFC/0000-research-brief.md` for citations.

## 1. Product Thesis

### Who it's for
Solo founders and small engineering teams using AI coding tools who want to
ship production-grade software without enterprise process.

### What problem we solve
AI coding tools produce inconsistent, generic, undertested output by default.
Without discipline, the result is "AI-slop": code that compiles and tests
pass, but architecture is wrong, security is shallow, launch copy is generic,
nobody can resume after a context flush.

### What we are
Godpowers is a **skill system for AI-assisted product development**. Slash
commands inside your AI coding tool orchestrate specialist agents in fresh
contexts to produce mechanically-verified artifacts on disk.

### Core promise
> Type one slash command. Get a hardened, observable, deployed product, every
> step traceable, every artifact accountable.

### Core surface (pure-skill foundation)
- Skills at `<runtime>/skills/god-*.md` invoked as slash commands
- Specialist agents at `<runtime>/agents/god-*.md` spawned via Task tool
- Single CLI surface: `npx godpowers` for install, uninstall, read-only status,
  executable tier gates, dogfood, and extension scaffolding
- Hooks for SessionStart and PreToolUse
- Portable project context in `AGENTS.md` and `agents/*.md` (Pillars 1.1 layout)
- Disk-authoritative state in `.godpowers/`

---

## 2. Native Context And Load-Bearing Artifacts

Godpowers separates portable project context from workflow state. The context
files describe durable project truth any coding agent can read, whether or not it
knows anything about Godpowers. The `.godpowers` files describe the Godpowers
workflow, artifacts, and execution history.

The context layout follows [Pillars](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/pillars), an
open convention for splitting project truth into a root protocol file plus
per-area notes so a tool can load only what a task needs. Nothing is installed
for it; the files are plain markdown. Godpowers implements the 1.1 spec and runs
that project's own routing fixtures in its release gate, so this stays
compatible rather than drifting into a private dialect.

Portable project context:

| File | Role | Pattern source |
|------|------|---------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | **Protocol**: how coding agents load project context | Pillars |
| `agents/context.md` | **Identity**: domain language and product invariants | Pillars |
| `agents/repo.md` | **Layout**: repository structure and naming | Pillars |
| `agents/*.md` | **Routed context**: task-specific project truth | Pillars |
| `agents/catalog.yaml` | **Absent inventory**: known concerns not yet authored | Pillars 1.1 |

Routing under that spec uses path-derived identities, portable ASCII token
matching, direct dependency depth, conditional soft references, scoped
exclusions, and root-to-target nested scope precedence. Specialist source
contracts are separate under `specialists/` and install into each host's
`agents/` registry.

Godpowers workflow state:

| File | Role | Pattern source |
|------|------|---------------|
| `.godpowers/intent.yaml` | **Intent**: what the user wants | Cargo.toml, package.json |
| `.godpowers/state.json` | **Facts**: what was resolved/done | Cargo.lock, poetry.lock |
| `.godpowers/runs/<id>/events.jsonl` | **History**: what happened | OpenTelemetry traces |
| `.godpowers/domain/GLOSSARY.mdx` | **Vocabulary**: canonical project language and unresolved ambiguity | Domain glossary |
| `.godpowers/REQUIREMENTS.mdx` | **Deliverables**: which requirements are done, in progress, or not started (derived by `lib/requirements.js`, cached in `state.json` `deliverables`) | Requirements traceability matrix |

Every other architectural decision falls out from how these two layers relate:
The `agents/` files carry portable context that any tool can read, while
`.godpowers` carries Godpowers-specific workflow state.

### `.godpowers/intent.yaml` (Intent)

Hand-editable. Reviewable. Created by `/god-init`. The document a human reads
to understand the project's shape.

```yaml
apiVersion: godpowers/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: myproject
  description: "..."

mode: A                  # A=greenfield, B=gap-fill, C=audit
scale: medium            # trivial | small | medium | large | enterprise

extensions:              # Optional: skill packs to layer on
  - "@godpowers/security-pack@^1.0.0"

workflow: full-arc       # references workflows/full-arc.yaml

executors:
  default: claude-code

config:
  yolo: false
  conservative: false
```

### `.godpowers/state.json` (Facts)

Machine-managed. Written by agents as they complete work. Read by every
downstream agent and by status/audit slash commands.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://godpowers.dev/schema/state.v1.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "project": { "name": "myproject", "started": "..." },
  "active-workstream": "main",
  "tiers": {
    "tier-1": {
      "prd": {
        "status": "done",
        "artifact": "prd/PRD.mdx",
        "artifact-hash": "sha256:abc...",
        "agent-version": "god-pm@1.0.0",
        "have-nots-passed": ["P-01", "...", "P-15"],
        "updated": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `.godpowers/runs/<id>/events.jsonl` (History)

Append-only. Crash-safe. JSONL for grep-ability. OpenTelemetry-shape spans
with attributes.

```jsonl
{"trace_id":"abc","span_id":"01","ts":"...","name":"workflow.run","attrs":{"workflow":"full-arc"}}
{"trace_id":"abc","span_id":"02","parent":"01","ts":"...","name":"agent.start","attrs":{"agent":"god-pm","tier":"prd"}}
{"trace_id":"abc","span_id":"02","ts":"...","name":"tool.call","attrs":{"tool":"Write","path":"prd/PRD.mdx"}}
{"trace_id":"abc","span_id":"02","ts":"...","name":"agent.end","attrs":{"agent":"god-pm","status":"success"}}
{"trace_id":"abc","span_id":"03","parent":"01","ts":"...","name":"have-nots.check","attrs":{"artifact":"prd/PRD.mdx","passed":15,"failed":0}}
```

This is the same shape as Datadog APM, Jaeger, Honeycomb. Future skill
extensions can pipe to those tools.

### Concurrency contract (advisory locking)

Godpowers is **single-writer-per-mutation** but **multi-reader-anytime**.
The contract:

- Reads (`/god-status`, `/god-doctor`, `/god-help`, `/god-version`,
  `/god-audit`) require no lock and can run any time, even while a
  write is in flight.
- Writes (any artifact-producing skill, `/god-build`, `/god-deploy`,
  `/god-undo`, `/god-rollback`, `/god-repair`, `/god-restore`,
  `/god-redo`, `/god-skip`, `/god-link`, `/god-scan`, `/god-sync`)
  acquire a cooperative advisory lock by writing the `state.json`
  `lock` object before mutating, and clearing it on completion.
- The lock has a `scope` (e.g. `tier-1.arch`, `linkage`, `all`). Two
  writers with non-overlapping scopes may run concurrently.
- Stale locks (past `expires`) are reclaimable by any actor; the
  reclaim emits a `state.repair` event with the previous holder
  recorded.

Why advisory and not OS-level: state.json lives on the developer's
disk, but the same project may be touched by multiple AI sessions, a
human editor, and CI workflows. An OS file lock would block none of
them. An advisory lock in state.json is visible to every actor that
respects the contract: today, the orchestrator and the recovery
skills. Editors that touch artifact files directly do not respect the
lock, which is fine: their changes show up as drift in `/god-doctor`
and `/god-repair` handles reconciliation.

Mode D (multi-repo suites) adds a second layer of locking at
`.godpowers/suite/lock`, owned by `god-coordinator`. Per-repo locks
stay local.

## 3. The Slash Command Surface

[DECISION] This is the canonical user surface. Durable project work happens
through slash commands inside the AI coding tool. The CLI exists for install,
uninstall, legacy migration, and read-only status helpers.

### The CLI surface

```bash
# Install
npx godpowers --claude --global
npx godpowers --all                    # all 15 runtimes

# Uninstall
npx godpowers --uninstall --claude

# One-time migration (v0.3 -> v0.4+)
npx godpowers --migrate

# Read-only helpers and profile switching
npx godpowers status --project=.
npx godpowers demo --project=.
npx godpowers surface --profile=core --codex --global --dry-run

# Help
npx godpowers --help
```

[DECISION] The CLI may install, uninstall, preview or apply runtime profiles,
run sandbox proof, migrate legacy disk state, check gates, and read status or
next-route information. Durable project mutations remain slash commands inside
the AI coding tool.

### Route Topology And Automation Audit (2026-07-31)

[DECISION] The route graph is currently complete at the file level: 123
`skills/*.md` command files match 123 `routing/*.yaml` route files, including
the `god` front door and every shipped `god-*` command.

[DECISION] The source surface also includes 41 `specialists/god-*.md` specialist
agents, 13 workflow YAML files, and 45 intent recipes.

[DECISION] The current route graph has 68 built-in or local-runtime command
routes and 52 agent-routed command routes.

[DECISION] Eighteen command routes declare secondary or parallel spawns:
`/god-build`, `/god-design`, `/god-dogfood`, `/god-feature`, `/god-harden`,
`/god-hotfix`, `/god-hygiene`, `/god-mode`, `/god-party`, `/god-postmortem`,
`/god-prd`, `/god-quick`, `/god-refactor`, `/god-review`,
`/god-story-build`, `/god-sync`, `/god-update-deps`, and `/god-upgrade`.

[DECISION] All workflow `uses:` targets resolve to shipped agent files.

[DECISION] All 45 recipes contain at least one slash-command route, and every
recipe command reference resolves to a shipped command route.

| Surface | Current count | Automation interpretation |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Skills | 123 | Every command has a user-facing skill file |
| Routes | 123 | Every command has machine-readable routing metadata |
| Agents | 41 | Spawn targets are available for specialist work |
| Workflows | 13 | Arc execution has declarative DAGs |
| Recipes | 45 | Fuzzy intent can route into command sequences |
| Built-in routes | 68 | Local helpers need visible concise sync notes or logs |
| Agent-routed routes | 52 | Spawned work needs visible spawn cards |

#### Current Automation Ladder

[DECISION] Godpowers uses a four-level automation ladder so local runtime
actions, command routing, and agent spawning do not blur together.

| Level | Action type | Examples | Visibility rule |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Read-only detection | `/god-status`, `/god-next`, `/god-doctor` detect checks | Report source and confidence |
| 1 | Local safe sync | feature-awareness, reverse-sync, source-sync-back, repo-doc-sync, repo-surface-sync, route-quality-sync, recipe-coverage-sync, release-surface-sync, pillars-sync-plan, checkpoint-sync | Report `Agent: none, local runtime only` |
| 2 | Command auto-invoke | `/god-sync`, `/god-reconcile`, `/god-review-changes` | Show trigger, files, and next command |
| 3 | Scoped specialist spawn | `god-updater`, `god-docs-writer`, `god-browser-tester`, `god-harden-auditor` | Show spawned agent and owned scope |

[DECISION] Auto-spawn is allowed only when the current workflow owns the
surface being changed or when the user explicitly asks for the work.

[DECISION] Auto-iteration is allowed only after a verifier reports a bounded
failure with an owning agent and a clear retry condition.

[DECISION] Auto-invoked work must leave a transcript-visible card and a disk
artifact, log, or no-op reason.

#### Gaps Closed In This Architecture

[DECISION] Route spawn declarations must use atomic tokens. `/god-party` now
uses `built-in` as the primary route owner and declares selectable persona
agents under `parallel-spawns`.

[DECISION] `/god-story-build` now declares `god-planner` as primary and
`god-executor`, `god-spec-reviewer`, and `god-quality-reviewer` as secondary
spawns.

[DECISION] `lib/router.js` reads `execution.parallel-spawns` in addition to
primary and secondary spawns.

[DECISION] `lib/route-quality-sync.js` now detects symbolic route spawns,
unresolved agent targets, untyped contextual route exits, and agent-spawn
routes missing required trace events.

[DECISION] Agent-spawning routes must declare both `agent.start` and
`agent.end` in `endoff.events`. This makes auto-spawn visibility auditable
from route metadata before a command runs.

[DECISION] Contextual and choice-based route exits must include
`success-path.outcome` metadata with a type, label, reason, and allowed next
commands. This keeps flexible exits explainable without forcing false
precision.

[DECISION] `lib/command-families.js` is the UX catalog layer above slash
commands. It groups all commands into start, continue, build, verify, operate,
maintain, capture, recover, extend, collaborate, and configure, and it owns the
capture, work size, verification, status-view, and trigger-precedence helpers.

[DECISION] `lib/workflow-helper-groups.js` lets workflow YAML reference named
closeout helper groups while serialized plans still expand the exact helper
names. This reduces workflow drift without hiding automatic local work.

[DECISION] Standards coverage is enforced where route metadata owns durable
artifact-producing work. `/god-story-build` now carries the build have-nots
gate because it mutates source code.

[DECISION] Recipe coverage has been expanded for release maintenance, context
refresh, story work, and automation setup, in addition to existing docs drift
coverage.

[DECISION] `lib/recipe-coverage-sync.js` now detects missing high-frequency
intent recipes before a release or closeout claims full routing coverage.

[DECISION] `lib/release-surface-sync.js` now detects release-facing drift
across README badges, changelog, release notes, package guardrails, release
checklist policy, package lock version, dogfood tests, extension publish tests,
Mode D suite tests, and installer smoke tests.

[DECISION] `lib/repo-surface-sync.js` now checks Mode D suite readiness:
suite helper presence, suite command skill and routing coverage, roadmap
documentation, and test gate wiring.

[DECISION] `lib/dogfood-runner.js` now checks messy-repo fixtures for
planning-system migration, source-system sync-back, host guarantees, extension
scaffolding, and Mode D suite release dry-runs.

[DECISION] `lib/host-capabilities.js` now reports full, degraded, or unknown
runtime guarantees based on shell tooling and installed Godpowers agent
metadata.

[DECISION] `lib/code-intelligence.js` detects optional `ast-grep`, `sg`, and
LSP tooling, and host capabilities report that signal without downgrading
baseline host guarantees when these tools are absent.

[DECISION] `lib/extension-authoring.js` now scaffolds publishable extension
packs with manifest, package, README, skill, agent, and workflow files.

[DECISION] `lib/suite-state.js` now exposes a dry-run release plan so
`god-coordinator` can show dependent impacts before mutation.

[DECISION] `lib/dashboard.js` renders an action brief before the detailed
status sections. The brief compresses the next command, route reason,
readiness, host guarantees, and top blockers while keeping the full audit
trail visible below.

[DECISION] Feature awareness remains curated, and it now records
route-quality-sync, recipe-coverage-sync, and release-surface-sync as known
runtime capabilities. Repo-surface-sync remains the broad structural umbrella.

#### Disconnected Flow Watchlist

[DECISION] Repo surface sync should continue checking skills, routes, package
payloads, agent spawn targets, workflow metadata, recipe routes, extension
packs, and release policy before a release is declared current.

[DECISION] Repo documentation sync should continue checking README badges,
public surface counts, version references, release notes, and reference docs
before a release is declared current.

[DECISION] Dashboard status should continue reporting workflow progress,
proactive checks, repo docs, repo surface, runtime test, security, dependency,
and automation opportunities separately, with the action brief acting as a
summary rather than a replacement.

[DECISION] Route-quality sync, recipe-coverage sync, release-surface sync,
dogfood runner checks, host capability checks, extension authoring checks, and
suite dry-run checks are now implemented as local runtime helpers and are
included by release readiness.

#### Architecture Audit Playbook

[DECISION] `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the human map for command, action, and workflow
connectivity, while executable sync detectors are the source of current repo
truth.

[DECISION] A disconnected command is any slash command whose skill file, route
metadata, package payload, recipe reference, standards block, or next route
cannot be followed to a shipped artifact or an explicit approved exemption.

[DECISION] A disconnected action is any local helper, agent spawn, route side
effect, or auto-invoked repair that can run without visible trace metadata, a
declared owner, and a closeout artifact or no-op reason.

[DECISION] A disconnected workflow is any workflow job, dependency, local
helper, recipe, or command flow that cannot be parsed, planned, packed, or
traced back to a slash-command surface.

[DECISION] The architecture audit graph is:
`skills/*.md` -> `routing/*.yaml` -> `specialists/god-*.md` or built-in helper ->
`workflows/*.yaml` -> `routing/recipes/*.yaml` -> `docs/command-flows.md` ->
`package.json` and `scripts/check-package-contents.js`.

[DECISION] Workflow plans use schema helper IDs such as `source-sync-back` and
`pillars-sync-plan`, while `/god-sync` transcript output may show shorter
aliases such as `source-sync` and `pillars-sync`.

| Audit target | Primary executable check | Disconnection found |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Skill to route | `node scripts/test-repo-surface-sync.js` | Skill without route, route without skill, package entry missing |
| Route to agent | `node scripts/test-automation-surface-sync.js` | Symbolic spawn, missing agent, missing `agent.start` or `agent.end` |
| Route to next command | `node scripts/test-automation-surface-sync.js` | contextual next route without `success-path.outcome` |
| Route to standards | `node scripts/test-automation-surface-sync.js` | Durable-writing route without standards or approved exemption |
| Recipe to command | `node scripts/test-recipes.js` and `node scripts/test-automation-surface-sync.js` | Recipe with missing command references or missing coverage |
| Workflow to plan | `node scripts/test-workflow-runner.js` | Workflow that cannot load, plan, serialize, or expose helpers |
| Router to command | `node scripts/test-router.js` | Intent route that cannot resolve to the command surface |
| Public docs to surface | `node scripts/test-doc-surface-counts.js` and `npm run test:audit` | Count drift, stale version claim, stale package claim |
| Release package to runtime | `npm run pack:check` | Shipped package missing runtime files or including local-only files |

[DECISION] Manual architecture audits should run in this order: inspect
`/god-doctor` or `lib/dashboard.js` status, run repo-surface sync tests, run
automation-surface sync tests, run workflow and router tests, then finish with
`npm run test:audit` and `npm run pack:check`.

[DECISION] A stale audit finding should be classified before repair as one of:
missing file, unresolved owner, hidden automation, ambiguous route exit,
unsupported durable write, workflow parse failure, recipe coverage gap, package
payload gap, or stale public claim.

[DECISION] Adding a new command is complete only when the skill, route,
spawn target or built-in owner, standards policy, next route, recipe coverage,
package inclusion, docs surface count, and relevant workflow or command-flow
reference are either present or explicitly exempt.

## 4. Workflow Definition Language

Workflows are declarative YAML in the shape of GitHub Actions + Buildkite's
dynamic-upload trick. We do NOT invent a DSL.

The workflow YAML lives in skill-installable form at
`<runtime>/godpowers-workflows/`. The orchestrator agent reads it.

### Static workflow

```yaml
# workflows/full-arc.yaml
apiVersion: godpowers/v1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: full-arc
  description: Idea to hardened production

on: [/god-mode]

jobs:
  prd:
    tier: 1
    uses: god-pm@^1.0.0
    with:
      template: PRD.md

  arch:
    tier: 1
    needs: prd
    uses: god-architect@^1.0.0

  roadmap:
    tier: 1
    needs: arch
    uses: god-roadmapper@^1.0.0

  stack:
    tier: 1
    needs: arch
    uses: god-stack-selector@^1.0.0

  repo:
    tier: 2
    needs: stack
    uses: god-repo-scaffolder@^1.0.0

  build:
    tier: 2
    needs: [roadmap, repo]
    uses: god-planner@^1.0.0    # plans slices into waves; god-executor runs them under review

  deploy:
    tier: 3
    needs: build
    uses: god-deploy-engineer@^1.0.0

  observe:
    tier: 3
    needs: deploy
    uses: god-observability-engineer@^1.0.0

  harden:
    tier: 3
    needs: build
    uses: god-harden-auditor@^1.0.0
    blocks-on:
      - critical-finding: pause

  launch:
    tier: 3
    needs: harden
    uses: god-launch-strategist@^1.0.0
```

### Dynamic uploads (Buildkite pattern)

When a planner agent generates steps based on what it just learned (e.g.,
god-planner emitting per-slice executor jobs), it can append more YAML to
the workflow:

```yaml
# god-planner output:
- emit-jobs:
    - id: build-slice-1.1
      tier: 2
      uses: god-executor@^1.0.0
      with:
        slice: 1.1
        plan: build/PLAN.md#slice-1.1
      review:
        stages:
          - { uses: god-spec-reviewer@^1.0.0, on-fail: rollback }
          - { uses: god-quality-reviewer@^1.0.0, on-fail: rollback }
```

### Five workflow primitives (Anthropic-blessed)

We ship five primitives. We do NOT invent a sixth.

| Primitive | Example in Godpowers |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Prompt chaining** | PRD -> ARCH -> ROADMAP |
| **Routing** | Scale=trivial routes to /god-fast |

## 5. Agent Contract (Plugin-Style)

> STATUS: ASPIRATIONAL / NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. This section describes the
> target plugin-style agent manifest (versioned contract, `engines`,
> `contract.inputs/outputs`, `tools`, `events`). The agents shipped today use
> flat frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`); none carry the
> `kind: Agent` contract block below, and `schema/agent-manifest.v1.json` does
> not exist yet. Treat this as design intent, not current reality. See
> Section 16 for the migration note.

Agents are the unit of extension. Manifest is versioned (Helm pattern).

### Manifest schema (apiVersion: godpowers/v1)

```yaml
---
apiVersion: godpowers/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: god-pm
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Senior PM persona. Writes substitution-tested PRDs.

engines:
  godpowers: "^1.0.0"

contract:
  inputs:
    - name: user-intent
      from: .godpowers/intent.yaml#/metadata/description
    - name: project-state
      from: .godpowers/state.json
  outputs:
    - path: prd/PRD.md
      contract:
        template: PRD.md
        passes:
          - have-nots: [P-01, ..., P-15]
          - substitution-test
          - three-label-test

# Tools MUST be declared explicitly. No implicit-all.
tools:
  required: [Read, Write]
  optional: [WebSearch]

yolo:
  ambiguous-problem-space:
    action: pick-broader
    rationale: Narrowing later is cheaper than expanding
  domain-knowledge-gap:
    action: log-as-open-question

events:
  emits: [agent.start, agent.end, tool.call, artifact.created]

activation:
  spawned-by:
    - /god-prd
    - god-orchestrator
---

# Body: instructions to the LLM
```

### Why these rules

- **`apiVersion`**: Helm's lesson. Schema versioning from day one.
- **`engines.godpowers`**: VSCode's lesson. Compatibility ranges enforced at install.
- **`tools` required explicit**: Anthropic's rule. No implicit-all.
- **`activation.spawned-by`**: VSCode lazy-loading semantics.
- **`contract.outputs.contract.passes`**: enables mechanical verification.

### Backward compatibility

v0.3 agents (no contract block) keep working. `/god-doctor` warns about
agents without explicit contracts.

---

## 6. Plan-Then-Apply (Two-Phase as Slash Commands)

Terraform's only really good idea: preview before commit.

```
/god-mode --plan         # Show what would happen, ask for confirm
/god-mode                # Run (default: plan and confirm in one flow)
/god-mode --yolo         # Skip plan confirmation
```

`/god-mode --plan` produces output showing:
- Which agents will be spawned
- Which tools each will call
- Which files will be written
- Estimated cost (model tokens) and duration

User confirms with "go" or aborts. Same pattern for individual tier commands:

```
/god-prd --plan          # Preview the PRD agent's plan
/god-prd                 # Run normally (which always announces what it'll do first)
```

Plans are also written to `.godpowers/runs/<id>/plan.yaml` for audit.

---

## 7. Recovery: Forward-Only with Compensation

Flyway's lesson: true transactional rollback is impossible. Forward-only
with cheap compensation wins.

### Reflog (Git pattern)

`.godpowers/log` is append-only:

```jsonl
{"id":"01","ts":"...","op":"run","workflow":"full-arc","status":"success"}
{"id":"02","ts":"...","op":"extension.install","name":"@godpowers/security-pack","version":"1.0.0"}
{"id":"03","ts":"...","op":"agent.update","name":"god-pm","from":"1.0.0","to":"1.0.1"}
```

`/god-undo` reverts to state before operation N, executing compensating
operations.

### Trash (recoverable deletion)

Destructive operations move files to `.godpowers/.trash/<timestamp>/<path>`
rather than deleting. `/god-restore` recovers. After 30 days, automatic
cleanup (configurable in intent.yaml).

### Recovery slash commands (full list)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/god-undo` | Revert last operation |
| `/god-redo <tier>` | Re-run tier and downstream |
| `/god-skip <tier> --reason "..."` | Skip with audit |
| `/god-repair` | Fix detected drift |
| `/god-rollback <tier>` | Roll back tier and downstream |
| `/god-restore` | Recover from .trash/ |

---

## 8. Onboarding: One Slash Command

```
/god-init
```

This is the fly-launch / npm-init pattern, mapped to a slash command.

1. Detect project type (existing code, language, frameworks)
2. Print what was detected, allow override
3. Ask 3-5 questions max
4. Create `.godpowers/` with intent.yaml + initial state.json
5. Print contextual next-step suggestions
6. Suggest running `/god-mode` for full arc, or `/god-prd` to start manually

After install, the user opens their AI tool, types `/god-init`, and is guided
through. No CLI ceremony.

### `/god-help`

Discoverable, contextual:

```
/god-help                    # All commands grouped by tier
/god-help <command>          # Detailed help with examples
/god-help workflow           # Available workflows
/god-help extension          # Extension management
```

Every error from a Godpowers command ends with the most likely next command
(`gh` does this well).

---

## 9. Observability (As Slash Commands)

[DECISION] Three views of the same events.jsonl are exposed via slash
commands. The events write surface and reader commands are part of the current
runtime.

| Command | Output |
|---------|--------|
| `/god-logs` | Recent events as readable timeline |
| `/god-logs --since=2h` | Events in the last 2 hours |
| `/god-trace <tier>` | All events for a specific tier with durations |
| `/god-metrics` | Per-tier stats |

Example `/god-metrics`:
```
Tier           Duration   Pauses   Retries   Have-nots fails
prd            5m 23s     1        0         0/15
arch           12m 4s     0        0         0/12
roadmap        3m 11s     0        0         0/10
stack          7m 45s     1        0         0/5
repo           2m 8s      0        0         0/8
build          1h 23m     0        2         1/12 (resolved)
deploy         18m 2s     0        0         0/8
observe        9m 41s     0        0         0/8
harden         34m 17s    0        0         0/11
launch         11m 5s     1        0         0/8
```

Future extensions can export to Datadog/Honeycomb/Jaeger by piping the OTel-
shape events.

---

## 10. Extensions (Skill Packs)

In a pure-skill model, "extensions" are just additional skill packs published
to npm. Each pack drops files into `<runtime>/skills/` and `<runtime>/agents/`.

### Installation

```
/god-extension-add @godpowers/security-pack
```

The slash command:
1. Resolves the npm package
2. Verifies the pack's `engines.godpowers` is compatible
3. Copies its skills/agents to the active runtime config dirs
4. Updates intent.yaml with the dependency
5. Records in reflog

### What a skill pack contains

```
@godpowers/security-pack/
  package.json                       # npm metadata, engines.godpowers
  manifest.yaml                      # Capabilities declared
  skills/
    god-soc2-audit.md
    god-hipaa-audit.md
  agents/
    god-soc2-auditor.md
    god-hipaa-auditor.md
  workflows/
    soc2-arc.yaml
  have-nots/
    soc2.md
  templates/
    SOC2-FINDINGS.md
```

### Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: godpowers/v1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: "@godpowers/security-pack"
  version: 1.0.0

engines:
  godpowers: ">=2.0.0 <4.0.0"

provides:
  agents:
    - god-soc2-auditor
    - god-hipaa-auditor
  skills:
    - god-soc2-audit
    - god-hipaa-audit
  workflows:
    - soc2-arc
  have-nots:
    - prefix: SOC2
      description: SOC2 Common Criteria checks
```

Lazy activation: extensions don't load until their skill is invoked.

### First-party packs

| Package | Contains |
|---------|----------|
| `godpowers` | Core: 123 skills, 41 agents, 13 workflows, base have-nots, 5 external integrations |
| `@godpowers/security-pack` | SOC2, HIPAA, PCI auditors |
| `@godpowers/launch-pack` | Show HN, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers strategists |
| `@godpowers/data-pack` | Data engineering tier (ETL, ML, dashboards) |

Community packs follow the same shape.

---

## 11. Testing Strategy

### Three test layers

1. **Unit tests** (pure functions): schema validators, workflow parser, lock
   resolver. Fast, hermetic.
2. **Skill contract tests**: every agent ships `__tests__/` with fixture
   inputs. Test runner verifies contract: outputs match expected, have-nots
   pass. Extensions can't publish without passing.
3. **End-to-end tests**: spawn a slash command against fixture project.
   Mock model layer at SDK boundary (record real responses once, replay
   deterministically).

### `/god-test-extension <path>` (Nx pattern, as slash command)

Extension authors run this before publishing. The harness:
- Loads the extension manifest
- Runs each agent against bundled fixtures
- Diffs actual vs expected outputs
- Refuses publish on any mismatch

### Record/replay layer

`tests/replay/` holds recorded model responses keyed by request hash. Tests
intercept model calls and return recorded responses. Re-record:
`npx godpowers --test --update-recordings`.

(This is the one place we use the CLI beyond install. Test infrastructure is
not user-facing.)

---

## 12. Migration from v0.3 to v1.0

### Compatibility matrix

| Version | intent.yaml | state.json | events.jsonl | PROGRESS.md |
|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| v0.3.x  | absent | absent | absent | canonical |
| v0.4.x  | optional | new | new | canonical (back-compat) |
| v0.5.x  | required | required | required | generated (legacy view) |
| v1.0.x  | required | required | required | optional (read-only) |

### `npx godpowers --migrate` (one-shot CLI)

```
$ npx godpowers --migrate
  Detected: v0.3 project (.godpowers/PROGRESS.mdx exists, no intent.yaml)
  Will migrate to: v1.0
  
  Steps:
    1. Generate intent.yaml from PROGRESS.md mode + scale
    2. Generate state.json from artifact hashes
    3. Replay synthetic events.jsonl from artifact mtimes
    4. Archive PROGRESS.md as PROGRESS.md.legacy
    5. Validate against v1.0 schemas
  
  Continue? [y/N]
```

This is one of the rare CLI surfaces because it operates on disk before any
slash command can.

After migration, the slash command `/god-doctor` validates the new state.

---

## 13. Versioning and Compatibility

### Capability handshake

Each extension declares:
```yaml
engines:
  godpowers: ">=2.0.0 <4.0.0"
```

`/god-extension-add` checks compatibility before installing. Mismatches fail
with clear error and suggested fix.

### Schema versioning

| Schema | Stable from | Frozen at |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `intent.v1.yaml.json` | v0.4 | v1.0 |
| `state.v1.json` | v0.4 | v1.0 |
| `events.v1.json` | v0.4 | v1.0 |
| `workflow.v1.json` | v0.5 | v1.0 |
| `agent-manifest.v1.json` (planned, see Section 5) | v0.5 | v1.0 |
| `extension-manifest.v1.json` | v0.8 | v1.0 |

v1.0 freezes all schemas. v2.0 (if ever) is breaking. v1.x is
backwards-compatible within itself.

---

## 14. Anti-Patterns Rejected

| Anti-pattern | Why we reject |
|--------------|--------------|
| Adding a `godpowers` CLI binary alongside slash commands | Doubles install surface; skills are sufficient |
| Storing state in conversation memory | Disk-authoritative is the entire point |
| Implicit `tools` (allow-all) | Anthropic's explicit rule; smoke test rejects |
| Tightly coupling agents to skills | Reuse impossible if 1:1 |
| Orchestrator doing the work itself | Context rot returns; reviewers can't be independent |
| Markdown-only state | Mechanical queries and drift detection require structure |
| Implicit contracts | Breaking changes silent; versioning impossible |
| Magic auto-everything | --yolo exists, but defaults are documented and logged |
| One-size-fits-all workflow | Scale-adaptive and extensions matter |
| Hidden dependencies | All gates explicit; DAG visualizable |
| Decoration emojis as quality signals | Real icons or none |
| Theater (sentences that decide nothing) | Three-label test catches this |
| Inventing a sixth workflow primitive | Use Anthropic's five first |
| Pure-imperative workflow definition | YAML + escape hatch wins |
| In-memory subagent context handoff | Files only; resumable, inspectable |
| Transactional rollback claim | Forward-only with compensation; honest |

---

## 15. Implementation Roadmap

| Version | Focus | Key deliverables (all slash commands except install) |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **v0.4** | Foundation | intent.yaml + state.json schemas, events.jsonl, `/god-doctor`, `/god-help`, migration script |
| **v0.5** | Workflow | Workflow YAML format, runtime, plan-then-apply via `--plan` flag |
| **v0.6** | Recovery | `/god-undo`, `/god-redo`, `/god-skip`, `/god-repair`, `/god-rollback`, `/god-restore`, .trash/ |
| **v0.7** | Observability | `/god-logs`, `/god-metrics`, `/god-trace`, OTel-shape events |
| **v0.8** | Extensions | Extension manifest, `/god-extension-{add,list,remove,info}`, first-party packs |
| **v0.9** | Distribution | npm publish, capability handshake, semantic-release |
| **v1.0** | Stable | Migration verified, schemas frozen, integration test suite, docs site |

Each release is independently shippable. v1.0 freezes the public API.

---

## 16. Mapping Current State to Target

| current v2.0.0 surface | v2.0 target |
|------------|-------------|
| `.godpowers/PROGRESS.mdx` (markdown) | `.godpowers/intent.yaml` + `.godpowers/state.json` + auto-generated PROGRESS.md (legacy view) |
| Implicit workflow in orchestrator prose | `workflows/full-arc.yaml` declarative |
| Prose-only agent files | Manifest YAML front matter + prose body |
| Smoke tests (structural only) | Unit + skill contract + record/replay E2E |
| `npx godpowers` (1 package, install, uninstall, migrate, status helpers) | Same mutation boundary. Durable project work stays slash-command driven. |
| 110 skills + 40 agents (shipped at v2.0.0) | Same surface. Declarative contracts via lib/workflow-runner.js. |
| HAVE-NOTS.md (markdown) | Same content + machine-readable index |
| Single-machine install only | npm-distributed packs, capability handshake |
| Slash commands as primary surface | Unchanged. Slash commands stay primary. |

The migration is additive at every step. v0.4 introduces structures;
v0.3 commands keep working. v1.0 freezes the public API.

---

## 17. Companion Tool Interop and Artifact Extension Policy

Godpowers reads the output of two separate companion projects without owning
them. Neither is required to run Godpowers, and neither depends on Godpowers.

- **godplans** decides a project's product, architecture, roadmap, stack, and
  tasks before code is written, and leaves a machine-checked master plan on disk.
- **godaudits** scores a finished codebase against a catalog of checks and leaves
  a validated report with typed remediation tasks.

Godpowers builds. When it finds either artifact it imports it rather than asking
the user to retype the same decisions, and it never writes into their
directories.

[DECISION] The consumed contract is `.godplans/PLAN.mdx` plus the executable,
pinned `.godplans/validate-plan.sh` companion (Godplans 1.1 master plan), and
`.godaudits/AUDIT.json` (godaudits 2.x canonical machine state),
with `.godaudits/AUDIT.mdx` supported as a generated report and 1.x fallback.
`lib/sibling-artifacts.js` is the read-only parser: it detects the canonical
source, parses `GP-nnn` plan tasks and typed `GA-nnn` remediation tasks, imports
the explicit check-outcome ledger, secret-safe evidence metadata, compliance
result, accepted risks, open questions, compiled score caps, and coverage, and
recomputes task and phase counts from plan checkboxes, and recomputes audit
counts only for legacy MDX. For Godplans, it performs a non-executing mirror of
the 1.1 structural gate, verifies the companion hash, file type, and executable
mode, exposes lifecycle status, and refuses GP dispatch for incomplete,
unsupported, `planning`, or `done` contracts. The official companion remains
the authoritative execution gate and must pass immediately before GP work.
Plan requirements use `R-<DOM>-n` ids and audit checks mirror them one to one
as `A-<DOM>-n` across the 18 shared domain codes; Godpowers preserves those ids
verbatim on import so traceability survives the handoff.

[DECISION] Open GA tasks are synchronized into a replaceable managed section
of `.godpowers/todos/TODOS.mdx`; user-authored todo content outside the section
is preserved. Finding severity maps Critical/High/Medium/Low to P0/P1/P2/P3.
Imported JSON strings are MDX-escaped, malformed managed boundaries fail
without writing, and canonical audit reads use a 5 MiB limit so the complete
414-check state is available to migration.

[DECISION] Sibling files are read-only for Godpowers with one carve-out: when
Godpowers executes a GP or GA task, the executing agent follows the owning
product's executor rules. A GP task may begin only from `approved` or
`executing` after `bash .godplans/validate-plan.sh .godplans/PLAN.mdx` passes.
The first executor moves `approved` to `executing`; passing tasks update the
checkbox, derived counters, date, and session log atomically; only final
Verification may move the plan to `done`. Material replans return to
`planning`, preserve completed task history, and require fresh approval. A
godaudits 2.x task
updates reciprocal task, finding, check, evidence, and audit metadata in
AUDIT.json, then runs
`godaudits validate .godaudits/AUDIT.json --write` and regenerates AUDIT.mdx and
SARIF when present. The generated report is never hand-edited. Every other
flow writes back only through `.godplans/GODPOWERS-SYNC.mdx` and
`.godaudits/GODPOWERS-SYNC.mdx` (lib/source-sync.js); fences are never written
into PLAN.mdx, AUDIT.json, or AUDIT.mdx.

[DECISION] Imports record a source fingerprint; Godplans 1.1 fingerprints both
canonical contract files plus the validator executable mode, while
`sibling-artifacts.staleness` compares the recorded set
against the current canonical source so drift between an imported
digest and live sibling state surfaces explicitly. For godaudits 2.x, only
AUDIT.json controls staleness, so regenerating AUDIT.mdx cannot create a false
drift warning.

[DECISION] Artifact extension policy: the canonical extension for
`.godpowers/` artifacts is `.mdx`. Reads are mdx-first with a legacy `.md`
fallback (lib/sync-fs.js: `resolveArtifact`, `readArtifact`); writes always
use the canonical `.mdx` name, and lib-owned generated files absorb a legacy
`.md` twin on first write. Exemptions that stay `.md`: root `DESIGN.md` and
`PRODUCT.md` (impeccable convention), `.godpowers/cache/` (external tool
outputs), foreign planning-system markers (`.planning/STATE.md`, `BMAD.md`,
and kin), and host pointer files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, ...).

## Appendix: Why These Specific Patterns

The architecture is grounded in concrete patterns from production tools.

| Pattern | Source | Where it lives in Godpowers |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| Intent + facts split | Cargo, Poetry | intent.yaml + state.json |
| OTel trace/span/event | OpenTelemetry | events.jsonl shape |
| Workflow YAML | GitHub Actions, Tekton | workflows/*.yaml |
| Dynamic step upload | Buildkite | Planner emits jobs |
| `apiVersion` in manifest | Helm | All schemas |
| Lazy plugin activation | VSCode | activation.spawned-by |
| Explicit tools per agent | Anthropic | Agent manifest |
| Five workflow primitives | Anthropic | The only patterns we ship |
| Plan-then-apply | Terraform | `--plan` flag on commands |
| Forward-only + compensation | Flyway | `/god-undo` |
| Reflog | Git | `.godpowers/log` |
| Magic init command | Fly, npm-init | `/god-init` (slash, not CLI) |
| Plugin contract tests | Nx | `/god-test-extension` |
| Record/replay | proven pattern | tests/replay/ |
| Capability handshake | npm engines | engines.godpowers |
| Skill-only surface | pure-skill model | The whole product |

If a design question comes up, look it up in this table first.
