# Godpowers Have-Nots Catalog

> Named failure modes that disqualify an artifact. Each is grep-testable.
> Spawned agents check their tier's have-nots before declaring done.
> god-auditor uses this catalog to score retroactively.

This document is the canonical source. If a have-not appears in an agent file
that contradicts this document, this document wins.

## Ledger states

A have-not is scored into one of four states, never two. The godaudits sibling
already reports on this ledger; godpowers now writes it the same way, so a
finding means the same thing on both sides of the handoff.

| State | What the checker is saying |
|---|---|
| `pass` | the check ran and the artifact satisfies it |
| `fail` | the check ran and the artifact violates it |
| `unknown` | the check did not run, or the evidence needed to decide it was not available |
| `not-applicable` | the check cannot apply here, with the reason recorded |

**`unknown` is not `pass`, and it is not `not-applicable`.** A check that never
ran reported as a pass is how a clean score gets manufactured, and reported as
not-applicable is how a gap becomes a decision nobody made. When a checker cannot
reach the evidence, it says `unknown` and names what it would need. A summary that
prints only pass and fail counts is hiding the third number.

`not-applicable` carries a reason. An unexplained `not-applicable` is worse than a
`fail`, because a fail is visible and arguable and this is not.

## Universal Have-Nots (apply to ALL artifacts and code)

### U-01 AI-slop
Output passes the substitution test. Replace the product name with a competitor's;
if the sentence still reads true, the content decides nothing. Fail.

- **Bad**: "Our platform delivers a seamless, best-in-class user experience."
  Swap in any competitor and it still reads true, so it decides nothing.
- **Good**: "Checkout completes in two taps because we store the card token after
  the first purchase; a competitor asking for full card entry cannot claim this."
  It names a specific mechanism a rival could not copy verbatim.

### U-02 Unlabeled sentence
A sentence is not tagged DECISION, HYPOTHESIS, or OPEN QUESTION. Anything
unlabeled is theater. Fail.

- **Bad**: "We will probably use Postgres." Unlabeled and hedged; the reader
  cannot tell if it is a decision, a guess, or an open question.
- **Good**: "DECISION: Use Postgres for the primary store (relational data, team
  familiarity); flip to DynamoDB if sustained writes exceed 5k/s." One label, a
  rationale, and a flip point.

### U-03 Phantom resume
Agent claims a tier is "done" but the artifact is missing from disk. Fail.

### U-04 Ghost handoff
A tier is invoked before its upstream artifact exists on disk. Fail.

### U-05 Rubber-stamp orchestration
PROGRESS.mdx says "done" with no corresponding artifact on disk. Fail.

- **Bad**: the orchestrator marks tier-1.prd done because the PM agent replied
  "PRD complete", but `.godpowers/prd/PRD.mdx` does not exist on disk.
- **Good**: the orchestrator confirms `.godpowers/prd/PRD.mdx` exists and clears
  the have-nots gate before advancing state; the agent's claim is not the proof.

### U-06 Silence as skip
A tier is absent from PROGRESS.mdx (neither done nor skipped). Fail.

### U-07 Paper artifact
The document exists but the mechanism it describes does not. Example: a runbook
that has never been executed. Fail.

### U-08 Em or en dashes
Em dash (U+2014) or en dash (U+2013) used in any output. Fail. Use commas,
colons, semicolons, parentheses, or hyphens for ranges.

### U-09 Decorative emoji
Emoji used as decoration in code, docs, commit messages. Fail. Use words or
real icons (SVG/icon library) when a visual marker is genuinely needed.

### U-10 Phantom reference
Document references another artifact that does not exist on disk. Fail.

### U-11 Date-not-real
Timestamp claimed in artifact is in the future or before the project started.
Fail.

### U-12 Theater sentences
Sentences that read fine but say nothing measurable, decidable, or testable.
Fail.

### U-13 MDX-unsafe artifact content
Artifact body contains content that breaks MDX compilation or violates the
ASCII policy: a bare `<` followed by a letter outside code, a bare `{` or `}`
outside code, an HTML comment (`<!--`) outside code, or a banned character
(em dash U+2014, en dash U+2013, smart quotes U+2018/U+2019/U+201C/U+201D,
ellipsis U+2026, unicode arrows, emoji). Inline code spans and fenced code
blocks are exempt from the structural checks; banned characters fail
everywhere. Fail.

### U-14 Sycophancy or gratitude loop
Output contains gratitude-loop or forced-engagement filler: thanking the person
merely for their message, praising the question, help-eagerness ("happy to
help"), a "hope this helps" sign-off, or soliciting continued engagement ("let
me know if you", "feel free to reach out", "is there anything else"). This is the
mechanical enforcement of the honest-voice section of `references/shared/VOICE.md`
via `lib/voice-lint.js`. Fail.

- **Bad**: "Great question! Happy to help. Let me know if you'd like anything
  else." Three filler phrases, zero information.
- **Good**: "Done. Tests pass; the migration is reversible. Next: run `/god-ship`."
  States the outcome and the next step, nothing else.

---

## Tier 0: Orchestration Have-Nots

### O-01 Mode not detected
PROGRESS.mdx missing the Mode field. Fail.

### O-02 Scale not detected
PROGRESS.mdx missing the Scale field. Fail.

### O-03 Tier missing from ledger
A canonical tier is absent from the PROGRESS.mdx tier table. Fail.

### O-04 Status outside vocabulary
A tier's status is not one of: pending, in-flight, done, skipped, imported,
failed, re-invoked. Fail.

### O-05 Decisions log empty after pause
god-orchestrator paused for human input but did not record the resolution in
the Decisions Log. Fail.

### O-06 YOLO decisions silent
--yolo flag was used but no YOLO-DECISIONS log was emitted. Fail.

### O-07 Invisible auto-invoke
Automatic local helper or specialist work ran without reporting the trigger,
agent status, helper result, changed artifacts, and next route. Fail.

### O-08 Stale dashboard closeout
A command completed without a disk-derived dashboard, action brief, or
recommended next command. Fail.

### O-09 Sync-back ambiguity
Imported legacy planning, BMAD, or Superpowers context exists but the project does not say
whether managed sync-back is enabled, disabled, or not applicable. Fail.

### O-10 Host guarantees hidden
The workflow relies on shell, git, npm, release tooling, or fresh-context
agent spawning without reporting host guarantee level. Fail.

---

## Tier 1: Planning Have-Nots

### PRD Have-Nots

#### P-01 Generic problem statement
Problem statement passes substitution test. Fail.

#### P-02 Generic target user
Target user is "developers", "users", "teams", or any unfilled noun. Must be
specific persona with role and context. Fail.

#### P-03 Metric without number
Success metric has no numeric target. Fail.

#### P-04 Metric without timeline
Success metric has no time bound (date, days, weeks). Fail.

#### P-05 Metric without measurement method
Success metric does not specify HOW it will be measured. Fail.

#### P-06 Requirement without acceptance criteria
A functional requirement has no observable acceptance criterion. Fail.

#### P-07 No-gos empty
Scope and No-Gos section is empty or missing. Fail.

#### P-08 Open question without owner
An open question has no named owner. Fail.

Exempt: a `## Not Yet Specified` section (fog of war). A question you cannot
yet phrase sharply cannot be assigned. See `references/planning/WAYFINDING.md`.

#### P-09 Open question without due date
An open question has no due date. "TBD" is not a date. Fail.

Exempt: a `## Not Yet Specified` section, for the same reason as P-08.

#### P-10 Solution-first PRD
Problem statement names the solution. The PRD frames the problem; the
architecture proposes the solution. Fail.

#### P-11 Feature laundry list
Functional requirements are an unprioritized list with no MUST/SHOULD/COULD
classification. Fail.

#### P-12 Hollow PRD
All sections are filled but no decisions are made. Every claim is
[HYPOTHESIS] with no validation plans. Fail.

#### P-13 Moving-target PRD
PRD edited silently after downstream tiers consumed it. Edits must be tracked
and downstream tiers must be re-validated. Fail.

#### P-14 Assumption-soup PRD
PRD is full of "we assume users will love it" or "users want X" without
research or hypothesis labels. Fail.

#### P-15 NFR absent
Non-functional requirements section is missing or empty. Fail.

### Architecture Have-Nots

#### A-01 Box without responsibility
A diagram component has no clear single responsibility. Fail.

#### A-02 Shared responsibility unjustified
Two components share the same responsibility without explicit justification.
Fail.

#### A-03 NFR not mapped
An NFR from the PRD has no corresponding architectural choice in the
NFR-to-Architecture map. Fail.

#### A-04 ADR without flip point
An ADR has no flip point (condition under which the decision reverses). Fail.

#### A-05 "Scalable" without numbers
The word "scalable" appears without quantification (users, requests/sec, data
volume, latency targets). Fail.

#### A-06 Trust boundary missing
An external integration has no trust boundary documented. Fail.

#### A-07 Data ownership unassigned
A data entity has no owner service. Fail.

#### A-08 Architecture theater
Diagrams exist but no load-bearing decisions are documented. Fail.

#### A-09 Cargo-cult cloud-native
Kubernetes/Kafka/microservices for a 10-user CRUD app. Complexity must match
scale from PRD. Fail.

#### A-10 Stackitecture
Stack chosen and called architecture. Architecture is system shape; stack is
tool selection. Distinct documents. Fail.

#### A-11 Resume-driven architecture
Choice motivated by "looks good on resume" rather than fit-for-PRD. Fail.

#### A-12 Paper-tiger architecture
Looks robust on paper but fails first real load. NFR validation must include
worst-case analysis. Fail.

#### A-13 ADR inflation
An ADR records a decision that is easy to reverse, obvious without context, or
not the result of a real tradeoff. Fail.

### Domain Glossary Have-Nots

#### DG-01 Canonical term without avoided aliases
A glossary term names the canonical language but does not list avoided aliases.
Fail.

#### DG-02 Implementation detail in glossary
The domain glossary stores implementation details, stack choices, code paths,
or technical scratch notes. The glossary is domain language only. Fail.

#### DG-03 Unresolved ambiguity without owner or due date
An ambiguity is recorded without an owner or due date. Fail.

#### DG-04 Relationship uses non-canonical term
A relationship references a term that is not defined in the glossary language
section. Fail.

#### DG-05 Definition does behavior work
A definition describes what the system does instead of what the term is. Fail.

### Roadmap Have-Nots

#### R-01 Generic milestone goal
Milestone goal passes substitution test. Fail.

#### R-02 Subjective completion gate
Completion gate is "feels done" or "looks good" rather than observable. Fail.

#### R-03 Speculative feature
Roadmap milestone includes a feature not in the PRD. Fail.

#### R-04 No prioritization
All milestones are the same size. No real ordering. Fail.

#### R-05 No dependency edges
Milestones have no documented dependencies. Fail.

#### R-06 Fictional precision
Day-level dates without a documented capacity input (team size, velocity).
Fail.

#### R-07 Empty Later
Later section is missing or empty. No long-term direction. Fail.

#### R-08 Quarter-stuffing
All four quarters are equally full. Real prioritization tapers. Fail.

#### R-09 Shelf roadmap
Roadmap written once, never consulted. Must show update timestamps. Fail.

#### R-10 Roadmap theater
Gantt aesthetics with no actual commitments. Fail.

### Wayfinding Have-Nots

Apply to charts (`.godpowers/charts/<slug>/CHART.mdx`) and the decision units
they index. See `references/planning/WAYFINDING.md`.

#### W-01 Destination restates the idea
The Destination section repeats the request instead of naming an end state the
chart can be judged complete against. "Figure out notifications" is not a
destination. Fail.

#### W-02 Chart restates its units
A decision is written out in the chart body rather than gisted with a link to
the unit that holds it. The chart is an index; a second copy drifts. Fail.

#### W-03 Decision unit ships behavior
A unit whose kind is not `slice` carries acceptance criteria, a slice plan, or
implementation work. That is a build slice wearing a decision label. Fail.

#### W-04 Fog pre-sliced
Not Yet Specified holds unit-sized, sharply phrased entries. If it can be
stated precisely it is a unit, not fog. Fail.

#### W-05 Out-of-scope work filed as fog
Work ruled beyond the destination sits in Not Yet Specified, where it will
graduate. Out of scope is terminal and belongs in Out of Scope. Fail.

#### W-06 Unit worked without a claim
Work started on a unit that was never claimed, or claimed with no `owner`. An
unheld claim cannot be told apart from another session's. Fail.

#### W-07 Agent answers a human-only unit
A unit marked `hitl: true` was resolved without the human, including under
`--yolo`. An agent that answers its own grilling questions produced a guess
with a timestamp. Fail.

#### W-08 Unit deleted instead of closed
A unit ruled out of scope was deleted rather than closed with a
`closed-reason`. Deleting discards the evidence the judgement was made. Fail.

### Stack Have-Nots

#### S-01 Choice without flip point
Tech choice has no documented flip point. Fail.

#### S-02 Choice without lock-in cost
Tech choice has no lock-in cost classification. Fail.

#### S-03 Pairing incompatibility
Chosen technologies don't work together (e.g., ORM doesn't support DB). Fail.

#### S-04 High lock-in danger
High lock-in choice with likely flip point in <6 months without mitigation
plan. Fail.

#### S-05 "Best practice" without rationale
Choice justified by "industry best practice" without specific tie to ARCH or
PRD. Fail.

---

## Tier 2: Building Have-Nots

### Repo Scaffold Have-Nots

#### RP-01 README is template
README contains TODO markers, lorem ipsum, or placeholder text. Fail.

#### RP-02 No test directory
No test directory structure exists. Fail.

#### RP-03 No CI/CD
No CI/CD pipeline configured. Fail.

#### RP-04 No linter
No linter configured for the chosen language. Fail.

#### RP-05 No formatter
No formatter configured. Fail.

#### RP-06 .gitignore missing or generic
.gitignore is missing or doesn't match the chosen stack. Fail.

#### RP-07 SECURITY.md absent
SECURITY.md (vulnerability reporting) is missing. Fail.

#### RP-08 Scaffold-only
Repo structure exists but features are stubbed with TODOs or fake data. Fail.

### Build Have-Nots

#### B-01 Code before test (TDD violation)
Implementation written before its test. Fail. Implementation must be deleted
and rewritten test-first.

#### B-02 Test passes immediately on RED
Test was added but did not fail before implementation. Fail. The test is
wrong; fix it until it fails for the right reason.

#### B-03 Single-stage review
Only one review stage performed. Both spec compliance AND code quality must
pass. Fail.

#### B-04 Fat commit
Multiple unrelated slices in one commit. Fail.

#### B-05 Context rot
Agent reused degraded context window instead of getting a fresh one. Fail.

#### B-06 Stub in production code
Implementation contains TODO, placeholder, or fake data in non-test code. Fail.

#### B-07 Test suite failing on commit
Commit made while any test is failing. Fail.

#### B-08 Linter warnings on commit
Commit made with unresolved linter warnings. Fail.

#### B-09 No regression test for bug fix
Bug fix committed without a regression test that reproduces the bug. Fail.

#### B-10 Tests skipped or marked TODO
Test files contain `it.skip`, `xit`, `@Ignore`, or equivalent without
justification. Fail.

#### B-11 Implementation detail tested
Tests verify implementation details (private methods, internal state) rather
than behavior. Fragile and adds little value. Fail.

#### B-12 Hidden coupling
Slice modifies code outside its declared file paths. Fail.

---

## Tier 3: Shipping Have-Nots

### Deploy Have-Nots

#### D-01 Different build per environment
Each environment builds its own artifact. Fail. Build once; promote the same
artifact.

#### D-02 No rollback plan
Deploy procedure has no documented rollback steps. Fail.

#### D-03 Untested rollback
Rollback documented but never executed in staging. Paper rollback. Fail.

#### D-04 TCP-only health check
Health check is just a port check. Must be application-level. Fail.

#### D-05 No smoke test
No post-deploy smoke test that hits real endpoints. Fail.

#### D-06 Paper canary
Canary label exists but no actual traffic split. Fail.

#### D-07 No environment parity
Dev/staging/prod use different config shapes. Fail.

#### D-08 Manual deploy steps
Production deploy requires a human running commands. Fail. Must be automated.

### Observe Have-Nots

#### OB-01 SLO without error budget policy
SLO defined but no concrete action when budget is exhausted. Paper SLO. Fail.

#### OB-02 Cause-based alert
Alert fires on a cause ("CPU at 90%") not a symptom ("users seeing errors").
Fail.

#### OB-03 Alert without runbook
Alert fires with no linked runbook for the on-call to follow. Fail.

#### OB-04 Untested runbook
Runbook exists but has never been dry-run. Paper runbook. Fail.

#### OB-05 Blind dashboard
Dashboard not tied to any SLO. Vanity metrics. Fail.

#### OB-06 Sensitive data in logs
Logs contain passwords, tokens, full PII, or other sensitive data. Fail.

#### OB-07 Alert fatigue
Alert that's fired more than 3x in 24 hours and ignored. Either tune or delete.
Fail.

#### OB-08 No tracing
Multi-service architecture with no distributed tracing. Fail.

### Launch Have-Nots

#### L-01 Generic landing copy
Landing copy passes substitution test. Reads generic. Fail.

#### L-02 OG card unrendered
OG meta tags exist but card was never visually verified. Fail.

#### L-03 Same copy across channels
Identical message posted to Show HN, Product Hunt, Reddit, Twitter. Fail.

#### L-04 Silent launch
Signups have no source attribution (no UTMs, no referrer tracking). Fail.

#### L-05 No D-7 to D+7 plan
Launch has no day-by-day runbook spanning the launch window. Fail.

#### L-06 Decoration-word landing
Hero contains "powerful", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary",
"robust" without quantification. Fail.

#### L-07 No post-launch follow-up
No plan for D+1 to D+7 (responding to comments, gathering feedback,
iterating). Fail.

#### L-08 "We'll figure out marketing later"
Launch tier marked done with no actual launch artifacts. Public activation
without a fresh hash-bound `.godpowers/launch/PREPUBLICATION.mdx` pass also
fails.

### Harden Have-Nots

#### H-01 Scanner-only security
Findings come only from automated scanners. No manual review. Fail.

#### H-02 Auth boundaries not tested
Auth/authz boundaries assumed from code reading, not actually probed. Fail.

#### H-03 No input validation audit
User input paths not systematically reviewed. Fail.

#### H-04 Rate limiting not verified
Rate limiting claimed but not tested with actual abuse simulation. Fail.

#### H-05 OWASP categories skipped
An OWASP Web Top 10:2025 category lacks a reproducible manual procedure and
result, or is marked Not Applicable without project-specific justification.
Fail.

#### H-06 Findings without severity
Finding exists but has no Critical/High/Medium/Low classification. Fail.

#### H-07 Critical without remediation
Critical finding presented to user with no remediation options. Fail.

#### H-08 Hardening as ritual
Annual pen test only, nothing between. Fail.

#### H-09 Compliance without security
Compliance checklist green but app still has exploitable holes. Fail.

#### H-10 Dependency CVEs ignored
Known CVEs in dependencies with no remediation plan. Fail.

#### H-11 Paper trust boundaries
Trust boundaries declared in docs but absent in code. Fail.

---

## Workflow-Specific Have-Nots

These apply to artifacts produced by focused workflows (postmortem, spike,
migration, docs, deps).

### Postmortem Have-Nots

#### PM-01 Vague action items
Action items like "communicate better" or "more tests" without specifics. Fail.

#### PM-02 Action item without owner
Action item has no named owner. Fail.

#### PM-03 Action item without due date
Action item has no specific due date. Fail.

#### PM-04 Action item without success criterion
No observable way to know the action item worked. Fail.

#### PM-05 Symptom-level root cause
Root cause is the symptom, not the underlying mechanism. Didn't go deep
enough. Fail.

#### PM-06 No class-of-bug identified
Postmortem describes only the instance, not the broader pattern that could
produce similar incidents. Fail.

#### PM-07 Person-blaming language
Phrasing blames individuals ("Alice forgot X") instead of systems ("the
deploy script does not check X"). Fail.

#### PM-08 Runbooks not updated
Incident revealed runbook gaps; gaps not addressed. Fail.

### Spike Have-Nots

#### SP-01 Time-box exceeded silently
Spent significantly more than time-box without escalating to user. Fail.

#### SP-02 Built a feature instead of a proof
Spike code is production-grade or merge-ready instead of throwaway. Fail.

#### SP-03 Findings without evidence
Claims like "this approach is faster" without numbers, code excerpts, or
test results backing them. Fail.

#### SP-04 No recommendation
Findings list options but make no recommendation. "It depends" with no
decision support. Fail.

#### SP-05 Spike code merged to main
Spike code reaches production rather than being deleted or rewritten cleanly
in a real workflow. Fail.

### Migration Have-Nots

#### MG-01 Big-bang plan
No incremental slices; everything migrates at once. Fail.

#### MG-02 No expand-contract
Old version removed before new version proven. Fail.

#### MG-03 No rollback per slice
Each migration step lacks an independent rollback. Fail.

#### MG-04 Tests not added before migration
Insufficient test coverage on affected surface; migration proceeded anyway.
Fail.

#### MG-05 Metrics not gating progression
Slices ship without verifying production metrics before next slice. Fail.

#### MG-06 Old code removed before 100% migrated
Contract phase started before expand phase complete. Fail.

#### MG-07 Just-upgrade-and-pray
No risk assessment, no compensation plan. Fail.

### Docs Have-Nots

#### DC-01 Doc claim contradicts code
A claim in docs is not true of the actual code. Fail.

#### DC-02 Substitution-test passes
Doc paragraph reads true for any product. Fail.

#### DC-03 Examples don't run
Code examples in docs would error if executed. Fail.

#### DC-04 Runbook untested
Runbook in docs has never been executed. Fail.

#### DC-05 Diagrams represent past or future state
Diagrams reflect what was, not what is, or what's planned, not what's
shipped. Fail.

#### DC-06 Required document silently absent
The documentation profile marks a document required and no drafting pass produced
it, and nothing in the manifest records the gap. Fail. A required document that
was consciously deferred is a row with a reason, not a blank.

#### DC-07 Not-applicable without evidence state, reason, or tripwire
A manifest row marked not-applicable is missing any of the three: the evidence
state that licensed it (`absent` or `by-design`), a project-specific reason, or a
`revisit when` predicate. Fail. All three are mandatory, because an unexplained
exclusion launders a gap into a decision and nothing ever reopens it.

#### DC-08 Unknown reported as not-applicable
A row is marked not-applicable on an `unknown` or `hint` evidence state, so "we
did not look" is recorded as "we decided this does not apply". Fail. The row
becomes required, or it becomes an open question with a recommended default.

#### DC-09 Evidence artifact edited in place
A sync, update, or docs pass rewrote a `durability: evidence` document (a
post-mortem, a readiness review, a scan output) instead of appending a new dated
instance. Fail. Editing one destroys the only property that made it evidence.

#### DC-10 Vague tripwire
A `revisit when` predicate reads "later", "eventually", "post-MVP", "if needed",
or "TBD". Fail. None of those is an event anybody could notice, so the row is
permanent by accident.

#### DC-11 Boundary unstated
A rendered manifest reports documents as missing without saying it can only see
what is committed to this repository. Fail. One false "missing" for a document
that lives in a wiki discredits every other row on the page.

### Deps Have-Nots

#### DP-01 Critical CVE not addressed
Critical CVE found and not addressed without explicit deferral rationale.
Fail.

#### DP-02 Multiple major updates batched
Two or more major version bumps in one commit. Fail.

#### DP-03 No regression tests run
Updates committed without running tests after each. Fail.

#### DP-04 Bulk update without per-package commits
All updates in one commit, losing bisect-ability. Fail.

#### DP-05 Lockfile not committed
Dep changes committed but lockfile not updated or not staged. Fail.

#### DP-06 Changelog not consulted
Updates applied without reading changelog for breaking changes. Fail.

### Style Genome Have-Nots

The style genome is `CODEDNA.md`, owned by god-repo-scaffolder and contracted in
`references/building/STYLE-GENOME.md`. Two agents consume it as an input, so a
wrong profile is worse than none: god-executor will match it.

#### SG-01 Formatter parroting
A profile rule restates a convention the config map already assigns to a
formatter or linter (indentation, quotes, semicolons, line width, import order).
Fail. The genome says "run X" and spends its lines on what no tool settles.

#### SG-02 Numeric norm without measurement
A function-size norm, comment density, or naming split appears with no
`lib/style-stats.js` run behind it. Fail. An estimate with a decimal point in it
is an adjective wearing a number.

#### SG-03 Observed rule without a snippet
A rule tagged `observed` ships with no real 2-4 line excerpt from this repository.
Fail. Enforced rules cite their config; observed rules cite the code.

#### SG-04 Generic profile
A profile line survives the substitution test: it would read identically for a
different project. Fail.

#### SG-05 False anti-tell
The anti-tells section lists a tell this project does not actually deviate on, so
the check would flag conforming code. Fail. A false tell costs as much trust as a
missed one.

#### SG-06 Uniformity enforced over local dialect
The profile flattens a file's characteristic convention into the global rule
instead of recording it as a known inconsistency. Fail; this is itself catalogued
AI tell number 6.

#### SG-07 Stale stamp
The profile carries no version and date, or its date predates a formatter,
framework, or convention change. Fail. A stale profile silently mismatches every
new file, and god-executor trusts it.

**Total: 179 named have-nots.**

Each is grep-testable. Each is a documented failure mode. Together they form
the mechanical quality definition for Godpowers output.
