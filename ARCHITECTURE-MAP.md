## Connectivity Audit Map

`ARCHITECTURE.md` owns the architecture audit playbook. This map shows the
same connectivity as a graph that can be checked by executable tests.

```
skills/*.md
    |
    v
routing/*.yaml
    |
    +--> specialists/god-*.md
    |
    +--> built-in runtime helpers
    |
    v
workflows/*.yaml
    |
    v
routing/recipes/*.yaml
    |
    v
docs/command-flows.md
    |
    v
package.json + scripts/check-package-contents.js
```

### What counts as disconnected

```
Command gap:
  skill missing route
  route missing skill
  route missing standards policy
  contextual route exit missing typed outcome metadata

Action gap:
  route spawns symbolic agent token
  route references missing agent
  agent-spawning route lacks agent.start or agent.end trace event
  local helper runs without a visible owner, artifact, log, or no-op reason

Workflow gap:
  workflow cannot load or plan
  workflow helper is hidden from the serialized plan
  recipe has no slash-command route
  recipe references an unavailable command
```

### Executable audit commands

```
node scripts/test-repo-surface-sync.js
node scripts/test-automation-surface-sync.js
node scripts/test-workflow-runner.js
node scripts/test-router.js
node scripts/test-recipes.js
npm run test:audit
npm run pack:check
```

Current checked status:

```
repo-surface: fresh
route-quality: fresh
recipe-coverage: fresh
workflows: 13 loaded and planned
```

### Sync helper vocabulary

[DECISION] This map uses workflow schema names for canonical helper IDs and
keeps shorter `/god-sync` output names as aliases where users see them.

```
checkpoint-sync       -> CHECKPOINT.md refresh
dogfood-runner        -> messy-repo fixture runner
feature-awareness     -> runtime capability refresh
host-capabilities     -> host feature detection
pillars-sync-plan     -> shown as pillars-sync in /god-sync output
recipe-coverage-sync  -> recipe to command coverage check
release-surface-sync  -> release gate and package surface check
repo-doc-sync         -> public docs, badges, counts, and version check
repo-surface-sync     -> skills, routes, agents, workflows, recipes, package
route-quality-sync    -> route spawn, standards, and next-exit check
source-sync-back      -> shown as source-sync in /god-sync output
```

## Cross-Workflow Integration Map

Workflows don't just exist; they hand off to each other.

---

## Control Flow: From User Input to Committed Artifact

```
1. User types: /god-prd
   |
   v
2. AI tool loads: skills/god-prd.md
   (reads frontmatter, matches "Triggers on:" patterns)
   |
   v
3. Skill instructs: "Spawn god-pm via Task tool"
   |
   v
4. god-pm agent starts in fresh 200K context
   (reads state.json, intent.yaml, templates/PRD.mdx)
   |
   v
5. Agent does work:
   - Asks user targeted questions (if needed)
   - Drafts PRD per template
   - Runs substitution test on each claim
   - Runs three-label test on each sentence
   - Checks have-nots P-01 through P-15
   |
   v
6. Agent writes: .godpowers/prd/PRD.mdx
   |
   v
7. Returns to skill (via Task tool result)
   |
   v
8. Skill verifies:
   - Artifact exists on disk
   - Spawns god-auditor briefly to verify have-nots
   - Updates state.json (PRD status = done)
   - Appends events.jsonl: agent.end, have-nots.check
   |
   v
9. Prints to user:
   "PRD complete: .godpowers/prd/PRD.mdx
    Suggested next: /god-arch"
```

## Pause Flow

```
                Agent hits a pause condition
                          |
                          v

          format)            Critical    Other

                            Pause for     Auto-pick default
                            user          Log to YOLO-DECISIONS.md
                            (carve-out)   Continue
                                |          |
                                v          v
                            User answers  Continue
                                |
                                v
                            Resume agent
```

## Recovery Flow

```
                 Something went wrong
                          |
                          v

          /god-status  /god-doctor  /god-audit
          (read disk)  (validate)   (score)
                          |

         (reflog)   (re-run)   (mark+continue)
