## Overview

[DECISION] [One paragraph. What register is this (brand vs product)? What
does it feel like, grounded in named references? Who is it for?]

## Colors

[DECISION] [Explain palette choices. Why these colors, what they signal,
what they avoid. Reference impeccable's anti-patterns: no purple-blue
gradients, no pure black, no gray text on colored backgrounds.]

## Typography

[DECISION] [Why this type pairing. What each style is used for. Tabular
numerals for tables.]

## Layout

[DECISION] [Grid model, breakpoints, default spacing rhythm.]

## Components

[DECISION] [Name only the canonical components. Variants (hover, active,
disabled) are systematic, not bespoke.]

## Do's and Don'ts

- [DECISION] Do: [specific positive pattern]
- [DECISION] Don't: [specific anti-pattern to avoid]
