## Scope

- [DECISION] This pillar captures deployment and release context for Godpowers.

## Context

### Release Surface

- [DECISION] Godpowers deploys as an npm package published from tag-triggered GitHub Actions when provenance is available.
- [DECISION] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full matrix test suite and the Node 20 release gate on pushes and pull requests to `main`.
- [DECISION] `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs `npm run release:check` before publishing tagged releases to npm with provenance.
- [DECISION] `.github/workflows/publish-pack.yml` runs `npm run release:check` before publishing first-party extension packs.
- [DECISION] `package.json` exposes `bin.godpowers` at `./bin/install.js`.
- [DECISION] Manual tarball publish is a fallback only when the tag-triggered workflow cannot run, and provenance is unavailable for that publish.
- [DECISION] Source version `5.5.0` published through identity-bound provenance workflow 29264981272 from merged `main` commit `84fbd00066d2bd833929d6d0b6b769de45275313`.
- [DECISION] npm `godpowers@5.5.0` and `@godpowers/mcp@5.5.0` are the `latest` versions and their registry integrity values match the locally packed release tarballs.
- [DECISION] Isolated published-install verification passes for Quick Proof, read-only project inspection, dashboard, next route, Claude, Codex, and the MCP executable.
- [DECISION] The prior `v5.4.0` tag remains the tested rollback reference.

## Watchouts

- [HYPOTHESIS] A release is incomplete until git tag, GitHub release, npm version, package tarball, README badges, CHANGELOG, RELEASE, and local install verification agree.
- [HYPOTHESIS] Registry and published-install proof do not substitute for adoption evidence from an unaffiliated production user.

## Touchpoints

- [DECISION] Release truth synchronizes from package metadata, GitHub workflows, npm registry evidence, and authoritative Godpowers state.

## Gaps

(none)

### Godpowers artifact sources

- Sync mode: auto-applied by yolo.
- Related artifact: `RELEASE.md`.
- Rule: keep this pillar aligned when these artifacts change durable deploy truth.

### Extracted durable signals

From `RELEASE.md`:
- [DECISION] Godpowers 5.5.0 is the Arc-Ready and Pillars conformance release.
- [DECISION] The public surface contains 123 slash commands, 41 specialist agents, 13 workflows, and 45 recipes.
- [DECISION] The core package contains 107 runtime library modules and keeps zero production dependencies.
- [DECISION] The `@godpowers/mcp` companion remains read-only and shares version 5.5.0.
- [DECISION] Product routing selects one of six forms before applying product archetype, industry, or regulatory overlays.
- [DECISION] Each product form carries a distinct vertical slice and completion-evidence contract, so web assumptions do not leak into API, CLI, mobile, data, or infrastructure work.
- [DECISION] OWASP hardening uses the 2025 Web Top 10 and routes supply-chain failures plus exceptional-condition handling as first-class checks.
- [DECISION] Public activation requires `.godpowers/launch/PREPUBLICATION.mdx`, bound to the exact hardening findings hash, authoritative hardening timestamp, and Critical count.
